"Today, Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne announced that doctors will no longer need the government’s approval to prescribe CBD oil to patients - the non-psychoactive component of the marijuana plant.

All around the world, people are using cannabis to treat a variety of afflictions. From using cannabidiol (CBD) to cure cancer and alleviate seizures to smoking the flower to reduce depression and feelings of anxiety, it has been proven time and time again to be a medicine, not a drug. Fortunately, it seems New Zealand – a country of extraordinary beauty – is catching on.

On June 2, 2017, Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne announced that doctors will no longer need the government’s approval to prescribe CBD oil to patients – the non-psychoactive component of the marijuana plant. Dunne said that restrictions on its use would be removed. Until now, the herb has been classed as a controlled drug – similar to the U.S., where it is classified as a Schedule 1 drug.

“I have taken advice from the Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs (EACD) that CBD should not be a controlled drug and am pleased Cabinet has now accepted my recommendation to make this change,” said Dunne.”Therefore, I am now taking steps to remove restrictions accordingly.” “In practical terms, the changes mean CBD would be able to be prescribed by a doctor to their patient and supplied in a manner similar to any other prescription medicine,” he added.

Doctors will be able to prescribe up to three months’ supply of CBD to qualified patients. Understandably, this is being lauded as a big win for marijuana activists who desire to see the herb decriminalized worldwide, as it has killed 0 people and it is impossible to overdose on.

One main challenge to this new development is importing medical marijuana, as there is a limited range of medical-grade CBD products in New Zealand. Additionally, strict limits exist preventing countries from importing and exporting concentrates or the flower.

“However, we do know of at least one CBD product in development made to high manufacturing standards that will contain two per cent or less of the other cannabinoids found in cannabis,” Dunne said.

As the NZ Herald reports, CBD was first allowed to be used in New Zealand when Dunne gave approval for teenager Alex Renton to use it in his last months of life. At the time, NZ Drug Foundation director Ross Bell applauded the decision.

”It represents another positive move forward to remove some of the barriers that patients are faced with in accessing medical cannabis products,” said Bell.

Now, many more people will gain access to this herb that offers profound medical benefits. What are your thoughts? Please comment below and share this news!

"""I’m finally letting my hair down when I once used to shave it all off.”

A former attendant to the Dalai Lama is a completely renewed individual after receiving a massage in India that “reawakened her sexuality.” Damcho Dyson, a former Tibetan Buddhist monk, lived a simple life in a monastery in France for about ten years. After a trip to India, however, she rediscovered sexual passion and traded in her plain habit for skin-tight latex.

Some might judge Dyson, but she feels pleased with the transformation. The 45-year-old told the Sunday People:

“I’d been celibate for 10 years and, as a nun, my practice meant my brain was able to override my bodily needs. Lying there having that massage I had an epiphany. I suddenly had a sense of the vitality within my body and decided the time was right to leave the monastery.”

In addition to rekindling her sexuality, Dyson found herself empowered from wearing rubber. This was discovered after stepping into a shop that sells latex clothing. She said,

“The first time I tried on latex I felt empowered. It compliments the female form and somehow felt reminiscent of the ritual wearing of Buddhist robes. The shop owner and I became friends and she introduced me to the latex scene. I went to a club feeling all ­risqué, but I looked at other people wearing top-to-toe latex and rubber masks and realised I was actually quite conservative. I find the whole thing amazing and intriguing. It’s really liberating.”

Damcho grew up in Melbourne, Australia, and lives in South London. She was 23 when she first thought about becoming a nun and officially joined the convent six years later. She never had children and is presently crowdfunding her Ph.D. exploring human rituals. Most importantly, she has no regrets.

“I travelled around the Himalayas,” she says. “It was incredibly ­enriching and inspiring for me. But now I want to continue my contemplative adventure using a different medium.”

She says, “I still feel a bit like a naughty nun. But I’m a middle-aged woman who has ­always liked to express ­herself so why not? I’m finally letting my hair down when I once used to shave it all off.”

"Preliminary findings from McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and Tufts University indicate that pot actually improves cognitive performance.

Don’t believe the hype – cannabis is not a gateway drug, it is a medicine. From helping people naturally relieve their anxiety to literally curing cancer (over 100 studies have validated this ), the plant is incredibly therapeutic. Because it is classified as a Schedule 1 drug, however, marijuana is still illegal in many U.S. states.

Fortunately, new findings from a study published in Frontiers In Pharmacology seem to support arguments for its decriminalization. Preliminary investigations by medical researchers from McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and Tufts University indicate that pot actually improves cognitive performance.

For the study, entitled “Splendor in the Grass? A Pilot Study Assessing the Impact of Medical Marijuana on Executive Function,” behavioral scientists tracked 24 certified medical marijuana patients over a three-month dosing period. The patients were repeatedly measured for cognitive proficiency through a series of intelligence tests, including the STrrop Color Word Test and Trail Making Test.

Lead researcher, Staci Gruber, is the director of the Marijuana Investigations for Neuroscientific Discovery (MIND) program at McLean Hospital. As KINDLAND reports, her initial report is positive. The first benefit reported is that medical marijuana led to patients excelling at brainteasers with enhanced speed and accuracy.

Says the McLean Hospital report:

“After three months of medical marijuana treatment, patients actually performed better, in terms of their ability to perform certain cognitive tasks, specifically those mediated by the frontal cortex,” explained Gruber. Study participants also reported improvements in their specific clinical conditions, sleep, and overall health as well as a decreased use of conventional medications, particularly opiates. “We saw a 42 percent reduction in opioid use,” reported Gruber. “This is significant, particularly for those of us in Massachusetts and other areas of the country where the opioid epidemic is ravaging so many. This preliminary finding certainly warrants deeper and broader investigation.”

The preliminary findings from the McLean Hospital’s pilot study indicates that humans do receive benefits from smoking cannabis that exceed a temporary reduction of pain and/or anxiety. Considering one of the most common arguments against legalizing cannabis for recreational use is that it makes people lazy and stupid, this data has profound implications.

“People are going to use it,” Gruber concluded. “It’s up to us to figure out the very best and safest ways in which they can do that.”

"The rock legend, who died at the age of 27, can be seen enjoying music and the outdoors just one day before he overdosed.

Rock icon and legend, Jimi Hendrix, was a unique musician in this world. Born in Seattle, Washington in 1942, he learned to play guitar as a teenager and in the 1960’s, excited audiences with his innovative electric guitar playing. One of Hendrix’s most famous performances was in Woodstock in 1969, where he played “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Sadly, he died in 1970 from drug-related complications, leaving this world – and those who crave his music – too early.

Fortunately, his legacy lives on through his artistry and the last collection of photos captured one day before his death. The day before September 17, 1970, Hendrix stayed at the Samarkand Hotel with his girlfriend, Monika Danneman. As DangerousMinds reports, the pair spent the day strolling King’s Road, shopping for clothes, sipping tea in nature, and enjoying his favorite Fender Stratocaster guitar.

Following are the last known photographs ever taken of the rock guitarist who was only 27-years-old when he died. Years later, Dannemann revealed that Hendrix took nine of her prescription Vesparax sleeping pills, which is what caused an overdose.

"“Life begins where fear ends.” - Osho

Indian-born Shree Rajneesh, best known as Osho, was a mystic and spiritual leader that gained recognition during the mid-twentieth century. His teachings were considered controversial because of his socialist perspective. Osho was deported from the United States in 1985 following political upheaval and serious accusations stemming from his movement. He was then denied entry in more than 21 countries, forcing his return to India, where he passed away in 1990.

Osho’s teachings revolve around meditation, love and courage. He believed every human being was capable of enlightenment. According to Osho, this is achieved by shedding social conditioning and the “illusory sense of identity”. He teaches respond to life, rather than react to it, and let the self participate fully, rather than be limited by small patterns of thinking.

Despite the controversy that surrounds his name, Osho has made beautiful contributions to the study of enlightenment.

Here are some special selected quotes from Shree Rajneesh aka Osho, courtesy of Good Reads:

1. “Experience life in all possible ways — good-bad, bitter-sweet, dark-light, summer-winter. Experience all the dualities. Don’t be afraid of experience, because the more experience you have, the more mature you become.”

2. “Drop the idea of becoming someone, because you are already a masterpiece. You cannot be improved. You have only to come to it, to know it, to realize it.”

3. “Take hold of your own life.

See that the whole existence is celebrating.

These trees are not serious, these birds are not serious.

The rivers and the oceans are wild,

and everywhere there is fun,

everywhere there is joy and delight.

Watch existence,

listen to the existence and become part of it.”

4. “If you love a flower, don’t pick it up.

Because if you pick it up it dies and it ceases to be what you love.

So if you love a flower, let it be.

Love is not about possession.

Love is about appreciation.”

5. “Listen to your being. It is continuously giving you hints; it is a still, small voice. It does not shout at you, that is true. And if you are a little silent you will start feeling your way. Be the person you are. Never try to be another, and you will become mature. Maturity is accepting the responsibility of being oneself, whatsoever the cost. Risking all to be oneself, that’s what maturity is all about.”

6. “You feel good, you feel bad, and these feelings are bubbling from your own unconsciousness, from your own past. Nobody is responsible except you. Nobody can make you angry, and nobody can make you happy.”

7. “Falling in love you remain a child; rising in love you mature. By and by love becomes not a relationship, it becomes a state of your being. Not that you are in love – now you are love.”

8. “Nobody is superior, nobody is inferior, but nobody is equal either. People are simply unique, incomparable. You are you, I am I. I have to contribute my potential to life; you have to contribute your potential to life. I have to discover my own being; you have to discover your own being.”

9. “Your whole idea about yourself is borrowed— borrowed from those who have no idea of who they are themselves.”

"""Our city is in mourning, our community's anger is real, and the timing and subject of these events can only exacerbate an already difficult situation.""

In the wake of recent hate crime incited murders, Portland, OR Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) is seeking to block upcoming alt-right rallies in the city. Wheeler has asked the Federal government for help, since they have jurisdiction over the Terry Schrunk Plaza, where the “alt-right demonstrations” are planned to take place. Wheeler also said the city would refuse to issue permits for the event.

“Our city is in mourning, our community’s anger is real, and the timing and subject of these events can only exacerbate an already difficult situation,” Wheeler posted on Facebook. He added at a press conference, ”My concern is they’re coming here to peddle a message of hatred and bigotry. They have a First Amendment right to speak, but hate speech is not protected.”

Rick Best, 53, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, were fatally stabbed on the Portland train when they attempted to defend two women against “various remarks that would best be characterized as hate speech toward a variety of ethnicities and religions”, according to Portland police. The perpetrator, known white-supremacist, Jeremy Joseph Christian, is now in custody and has been charged with aggravated and attempted murder.

Mayor Wheeler is calling for the cancellation of the “Trump Free Speech Rally” on June 4th, and the “March Against Sharia” scheduled for June 10th. Joey Gibson, an organizer for both the events, won’t back down. Gibson posted a video on Facebook in response, saying “If they pull our permits, we cannot kick out the white supremacists, we cannot kick out the Nazis… Our speakers aren’t going to be filled with any hate.”

The ACLU of Oregon has also spoken out against Wheeler’s plan, posting the following tweets:

On a national scale, Trump has been pressed to stop perpetuating the underlying hatred and intolerance that often turns to life-shattering brutality. “President Trump must speak out personally against the rising tide of Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry and racism in our nation that he has provoked through his numerous statements, policies and appointments that have negatively impacted minority communities,” said Nihad Awad from the Center on American-Islamic Relations.

"The tech genius said that while college isn’t a bad investment, it is not for everyone as there are many tracks to success.

Tech genius Elon Musk – the founder of SpaceX, Tesla , and PayPal – doesn’t buy into the hype that in order to be successful, one needs a college degree. He admits that while having a degree doesn’t hurt, as the path ultimately exists to give one an advantage entering the workforce, he says it is unnecessary because plenty of people – such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates – have done well without obtaining theirs.

During the interview, which took place in 2014, Musk said:

“I ask them to tell me the story of their career, what are some of the tougher problems they dealt with…and how they made decisions at key transition points. That’s usually enough for me to get a very good gut feel about someone. What I’m really looking for is evidence of exceptional ability. There’s no need even to have a college degree. If you look at Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs…these guys didn’t graduate from college, but if you had a chance to hire them, it would be a good idea.”

A snippet of the entire length interview follows:

Without a doubt, education is one of the most worthwhile investments. However, Musk makes an important point when stating that a college degree isn’t necessary for success, quite simply because there are a variety of ways one can attain the knowledge required to excel in a certain field.

First of all, now that the internet exists and is easily accessible to all, information can be acquired at the touch of a button. Additionally, one can attend trade schools or take part in an internship to learn more about their desired field. Finally, college is becoming more and more out of reach for the majority of citizens in the U.S., where tuition is not free. By enrolling in a four-year institution, a newly graduated high school student acquires a substantial amount of debt which they will likely pay off for decades due to the present job market. Acknowledging all, it makes sense why Musk says college isn’t necessary.

"Feelings erupt as a herd of elephants runs to greet a new orphaned baby elephant.

Elephants are truly one of the most majestic animals on the planet. In addition to being intelligent and wise, they are empathetic creatures capable of feeling deep emotions. Sadly, due to poaching, the African elephant is expected to go extinct within the next 10 years. Environmentalists have a responsibility to raise awareness about this tragedy so conservation efforts may be boosted and the mammals given another chance to thrive on Earth. Fortunately, the following video – which almost seems as if it is from a Disney movie – does an excellent job conveying how precious elephants are, and why they need to be protected.

Uploaded by Save the Elephants Foundation, the video shows a herd of elephants running to greet a new rescued baby elephant named “Dok Geaw.” Dog Gaew is one year and nine months old and is an orphan. Fortunately, he seems to have found a new family that is ready to adopt him.

"Service dog is proven to be the ultimate good boy by earning a spot in the yearbook.

Most people understand the importance of service animals, which are usually dogs, and the variety of jobs they perform for their humans. While some working animals, such as police dogs or animals used in films, get to go home each night like humans and relax, service dogs have to perform their duties around the clock, even throughout the night while everyone in the house is asleep.

One such dog is Alpha, a 4-year-old member of the Schalk family in Fredericksburg, Virginia whose human, A.J., has Type I diabetes, which causes his blood sugar levels to skyrocket or plummet at any given moment. With Alpha there, A.J. is able to better regulate his blood sugar without experiencing the adverse and extreme symptoms as often, leading to a healthier life both in the short and long-term. Alpha uses smell to determine the changing blood sugar levels in A.J.’s body, and gives his human a paw when something is off.

“Alpha alerts me through smell, 20 to 40 minutes sooner than I know anything is wrong,” the 16-year-old said. “He has saved my life multiple times, especially at night, when low blood sugar can be super dangerous.”

While some people with Type I diabetes can get by without a service dog, it can be dangerous or painful to do so because the onset of changing blood sugar can cause injuries due to collapsing or be very uncomfortable due to labored breathing, vomiting, fatigue, and other symptoms. A.J. began bringing Alpha to school with him to help monitor his levels at all times last year, and his school, Stafford High School, was so supportive that they even issued the Labrador his own adorable school ID.

This school year, Alpha accompanied A.J. every single day, so A.J. decided to take it a step further and wondered if Alpha could be a part of the school’s yearbook.

“I contacted a friend of mine who is in yearbook, and we brought it up to the teachers and they were 100 percent supportive,” A.J. told HuffPost.

On the actual day the photo was taken, A.J. marveled at how easy it was to have the photographer include Alpha in the photos. A.J.’s photo was taken first, and then the photographer made a couple adjustments to take the Labrador’s photo, who was standing right next to his human.

“All they had to do was lower the camera and took the picture just like for anyone else!” he said.

This adorable act might have gone unnoticed by the world and been a local news story, except that a classmate who rides the bus with Alpha and A.J. received an early copy of the yearbook and could not contain her excitement. Diana Bloom, an 18-year-old senior at Stafford, took a photo of the page that Alpha and A.J. are featured on and posted it on Twitter, where it quickly went viral.

they put his service dog in the yearbook i'm CRYING pic.twitter.com/yU47kpKnwA — diana bloom (@nycstheplacetob) May 18, 2017

“I thought it was super cute that they put Alpha in the yearbook,” Bloom told HuffPost. “He does such a good job and he really deserved it!”

As for A.J., he’s just glad that Alpha was able to be a part of the school that he visits everyday with his human and he’s grateful for all that Alpha does for him. The 4-year-old lovable dog has a tough job to perform, but he does it with ease, without complaints, and has captured the heart of the entire Schalk family and the high school students. As a huge bonus, he has also helped A.J. cope with his lifelong illness.

“Having him at school and making everyone so happy has made my disability such a positive thing for me,” he said.

"Crayola is about to popularize the new blue by making it into a crayon.

It’s difficult to come by new colors these days, as the Earth’s naturally-occurring colors have been thoroughly researched and new ones created in scientific settings are dwindling in occurrence. In a small victory that will soon be celebrated the world over, chemists at Oregon State University discovered a new pigment of blue in 2009 that they called YInMn Blue. Though this isn’t the cutest name you’ve ever heard for a color, don’t worry, Crayola has got us covered.

The last shade of blue to be discovered and named was Cobalt Blue back in 1802. That means it’s been over 200 years since North Americans’ favorite color has seen any new additions to the family. Cobalt blue was discovered by French chemist Louis Jacques Thenard, but has since only been known as a color rather than a contributing member to science. Since cobalt has been found to be toxic when inhaled or ingested, its use in science has been limited and almost non-existent, though it is still used as a coloring agent for fashion items.

Crayola picked up the color recently and is now making it popular after recently retiring its Dandelion shade and announcing its intention to add YInMn blue to its box. Mas Subramanian, the chemist that discovered the new shade of blue alongside his then-grad student, has remarked on the similarities between Crayola and chemists.

“Curiosity starts at a young age, as chemists we are curious just like kids,” Subramanian said. “I can understand the excitement of adding a new crayon color to the box, like adding a new element to the periodic table.”

The shade is currently up on Crayola, who at first mysteriously announced their intention to release a new blue several months ago, and you can even submit a name for the new color up until June 2. The company will be opting for a darker shade of the pigment, which can be seen by visiting their website and looking at the spectrum. The color blue was chosen in general to replace the Dandelion color in their box because blue consistently is named as the favorite color for the majority of North Americans.

“With the discovery of YInMn brand new pigment, who other than Crayola would be best to bring it to life?” said Leena Vadaketh, Crayola’s VP of Research & Development, North America.

Shepherd Color Company, which licensed the color from Subramanian, is currently testing toxicity levels for the pigment in order to get FDA approval. Since the product will obviously be offered to children, the company needs to be absolutely certain that the chemical poses no risks to the users of the crayons. You can vote on the final name ideas this summer and it’s likely that the color will be released by the end of 2017. You can submit a name for the crayon and find more information here.

"This teen killed a turtle in the most inhumane way possible and posted photos for the world to see.

Most people are brutally aware of the cruelty that humans are capable of, which is often taken out on animals and now noticed more than ever because of our ability to access the Internet constantly and see visual evidence of such cruelty. While many people point to huge events or industries that exploit and torture animals, like the Yulin Dog Meat Festival or the meat and dairy industry, there are small forms of animal cruelty happening everyday around the world that people aren’t (and don’t want to be) aware of.

One such act that occurred last week in Boston was committed by 15-year-old Jonasia Simpson, who posted evidence of her cruelty on both Snapchat and Facebook. The teen, for no other other reason than that she was bored and wanted to try something ‘fun,’ decided to put her family’s baby turtle into a coffee cup and microwave the poor creature, causing it to overheat and explode in the worst death imaginable.

The baby turtle’s inhumane death was so unwarranted and grossly posted for everyone to see, showing that the teen not only didn’t care about the life or physical feelings of the helpless turtle but that they found enjoyment in the act and wanted to show off what she had done. When her post went viral because people were disgusted and outraged, Simpson responded on Facebook about how it’s just a turtle and people should “get over it,” even using the laughing emoji to show her complete disregard for animals.

Simpson soon deleted her Facebook account after receiving so much backlash, but not before those following the story found out that her mother, Shanitha Blocker, was aware that her daughter had done this and also did not care about the turtle, even encouraging her daughter for doing it. The creator of an online petition that urges Boston police to charge the teen with animal cruelty said this about the horrific incident:

“Her mother, Shanitha Blocker, was made aware of the atrocious and horrendous act, and instead of taking action or disciplining her daughter, she laughed and supported her daughter’s actions. “Not only did Jonasia kill her family pet, and not only did her mother support the actions, but they have shown together a complete disregard for the lives and welfare of all animals. Charges of animal cruelty must be brought against the two of them and they must be imprisoned or at the very least fined to the full extent of the law in the hopes that they never again get the opportunity to kill or harm another innocent, helpless animal.”

Besides the obvious horror of killing any animal in such a way, this act of cruelty has even bigger implications, especially because Jonasia is still so young. A fact that is becoming more well-known as vicious acts against humans happen more frequently is that many serial killers or those that are extremely violent in their adult life often have a history of abusing animals as a child. While many children will do things such as yank a dog’s tail or burn ants with a magnifying glass before understanding that these acts are wrong, those that have a strong inclination towards violence will carry these acts much further, going so far as to kill or torture them.

Jonasia Simpson you deserve a special place in hell. I hope you'll explode in there too. https://t.co/riEe6dqlsx — syafiq terry (@SyafiqTerry) May 19, 2017

Actually disgusted and so upset by this… If she ever did that to my tortoise, I'd put her in the bloody microwave. https://t.co/xsCa8vXa0u — george (@gwevs) May 19, 2017

Just saw a before and after pic of a lady putting a turtle in the microwave and I don't think I could be anymore upset with the world ☹️ — Victoria Patrick (@Victorialeigh55) May 18, 2017

Unfortunately, those convicted of even the most extreme cases of animal cruelty rarely face the fullest extent of the sentencing, as animals are often seen as less important than humans. What makes animal cruelty almost worse than committing the same acts on a human is that the animal is usually completely defenseless and without knowledge of what is going to happen to them. Hopefully Simpson and her mother will face some sort of penalty for their disgusting behavior; if you would like to sign the petition to urge the police to press charges, you can do so here.

"Her dark skin now defines her in a positive way that she can't stop smiling about.

Nyakim Gatwech, a model from South Sudan, has an iconic skin tone that is making waves in the modeling industry and causing companies to question beauty ideals around the world. Despite the confidence that she radiates, both physically and verbally, her journey to self-love and acceptance hasn’t always been smooth.

Growing up in South Sudan, one would think that dark skin tones are more than acceptable, since the region is known for having a population of people with generally darker skin than most other Africans. South Sudan is extremely close to the equator, where the equatorial sun is harsh and stays directly overhead for most of the day. This results in darker skin tones because the people have evolved to allow for more absorption of sun rays. Nevertheless, Gatwech still experienced feelings of insecurity and being bullied because of her exceptionally dark color.

“There was a time in my life where I considered bleaching myself to avoid the dirty looks, the laughter, and for boys to find me attractive,” she told Yahoo! Beauty.

Even after embracing her skin tone and moving to the United States to become a model, for which she now receives critical acclaim internationally, Gatwech still experiences rude comments and questions about her skin from people of all shades. Recently, she took to her Instagram page to share a story with her followers in order to raise awareness about some of the things that people of color are told/asked and explain how she has overcome her insecurities.

“I was [asked by] my uber driver the other day… ‘don’t take this offensive but if you were given 10 thousand dollars would you bleach your skin for that amount?’,” she recalled in the Instagram post that shocked her followers. “I couldn’t even respond I started laughing so hard. [Then] he said so that a no and I was like hell to the f*king yeah that a no, why on earth would I ever bleach this beautiful melanin God bless with me,” she said.

Today, Gatwech is called the “Queen of Dark” because of her exceptionally dark skin, which is especially evident when posing alongside other African models. She went from being told as a young woman that she was so black that she should “take a shower,” as though her skin tone could and should be washed away like dirt, to now wowing modeling agencies, photographers, fashion designers, consumers, and everyone in-between with her perfect complexion. She posted on Instagram about her new nickname and said that she is completely serious about her love for her tone, and why shouldn’t she be? Everyone should embrace their natural skin tone and the entire spectrum that their tone reaches, and Gatwech is no different.

“So my new nickname is Queen of the Dark and I love it I’m so thankful and grateful to all the amazing people showing me love and support and writing such powerful articles about me.. we are all beautiful in whatever shade of skin color God create us in. So why should the be dark bad? Embrace and love who you are and world would as well!! [sic],” Gatwech posted on Instagram.

Through her empowering photoshoots and social media posts, she is enlightening her followers on the ignorant people that she encounters on a daily basis in order to combat it while spreading self-love.

"The problem of food waste is a lot bigger than you think, but companies around the world are trying to combat it.

Food waste is a huge issue not just because of the implications it has on the economy that wastes money on food that will be thrown out but because of its massive effect on climate change and the environment. When food goes continuously wasted, it means that the areas that grow or produce the food may be making more money, but also that their land is being unnecessarily ravaged to produce more and more crops for industries that will later just dispose of the food.

While it’s already difficult for agricultural areas to keep up with the demands of a growing world population, add the perpetual food waste that coincides with this growth and you have a problem that requires fast solutions. This issue contributes to climate change in a number of ways, first by the increasing demand on lands that leads to desertification and last by increasing the amount of waste in landfills.

As nations struggle to come up with ways to combat this ever-growing food waste, startup companies are developing innovative solutions, some of which were presented at a conference in Milan earlier this month called Seeds and Chips. Thankfully, some of these solutions are not only practical but also very cool, and will hopefully draw in both consumers and businesses.

Former U.S. President Barack Obama spoke at the conference and pointed to innovation as a key for combatting climate change, saying that it would help achieve “a sustainable food future,” which includes reducing the hunger crises facing parts of the world today. “Part of this is also going to be wasting less food… especially when nearly 800 million men, women and children worldwide face the injustice of chronic hunger and malnutrition,” he added.

One idea that gained a lot of attention is Coffee Flour, which uses the cherry that’s extracted and discarded by the billions each year from harvesting coffee beans and turns it into flour. This invention is huge, because as the coffee industry becomes increasingly unstable and continues to ruin more lands as small growers expand their farms. Coffee Flour offers a solution by using the cherries to make flour, which can increase sustainability, reduce cherries that build up in streams and leads to greenhouse gases, support workers at the bottom of the coffee industry, and exponentially increase jobs to supply this new market with product. Watch the video below to find out how they’re doing it and why it’s awesome.

Another innovation that is taking off comes in the form of flour as well, but this time it’s made from beer—kind of. The company, called RISE, is a startup in Brooklyn that uses spent barley, a by-product of beer production, and turning it into flour that takes on the aroma and taste of the original brew. They locally source the spent grains, which have a great fiber and protein content, while being low in calories, and intend to sell the flour in bulk to bakeries and other places that need flour for their food, such as pizza joints.

One huge issue that the food industry faces today is the short shelf-life of fruits, which often travel across the world for days after being harvested just to arrive at the facility where it will be sold and not eaten for many days after the purchase date. Rotting produce makes up a large portion of what goes to the landfills everyday, and a simple solution is to find a way to prolong the shelf life of produce so that less is thrown away, which is exactly what Emiliano Gentilini has accomplished with his all-natural pesticide, Demetra. Italian biotechnology start-up Green Code, Demetra is made up exclusively of plant extracts and used post-harvest on fruit. It considerably extends the shelf-life of fruits by breaking down the onset of diseases and rot by up to 90%. With the treatment, you can also store the fruit at higher temps and cut energy consumption and emissions of pollutants associated with cold storage by up to 30% and 50%, respectively.

Winnow takes on a more general approach to cutting food waste by working with commercial chefs to help determine just how much of each product is disposed of on a daily basis using a smart scale and a tablet. Chefs weigh what they are throwing away everyday, which is recorded and used to develop detailed reports of what chefs can cut out by ordering less when it comes to ordering inventory. Instead of aiming to take care of the waste after it has been discarded, Winnow aims at making sure the waste never happens. Overall, they say they’ve helped businesses cut 8% of food costs and reduce half of all food waste.

These solutions are awesome and are living proof that ideas about how to cut food waste and better the world in general are still out there, untapped, and coming to life each year. Visit the different websites for these companies (linked above when mentioned) to find out how you can buy their products or where they source from.

"The whales’ deaths are symbolic of humanity’s shocking disregard for marine life.

In January, 29 sperm whales were found stranded on shores around the North Sea, an area that is too shallow for the marine wildlife. Only recently were details of the animals’ necropsy released. However, scientists were deeply disturbed by what they found in the animals’ stomachs.

According to a press release from Wadden Sea National Park in Schleswig-Holstein, many of the whales had stomachs FULL of plastic debris, including a 13-meter-long fishing net, a 70 cm piece of plastic from a car and other pieces of plastic litter.

Some suggest that the animals thought the items were food, such as squid, which is their main staple. Others, however, believe that the travesty is largely a result of humanity’s shocking disregard for marine life, which has resulted in an overabundance of plastic in the oceans.

Said Robert Habeck, environment minister for the state of Schleswig-Holstein:

“These findings show us the results of our plastic-oriented society. Animals inadvertently consume plastic and plastic waste, which causes them to suffer, and at worst, causes them to starve with full stomachs.”

Nicola Hodgkins of Whale and Dolphin Conservation echoed that statement. She stated:

“Although the large pieces will cause obvious problems and block the gut, we shouldn’t dismiss the smaller bits that could cause a more chronic problem for all species of cetacean – not just those who suction feed.”

This isn’t the first time a sperm whale has been found dead with innards full of inedible contents. In 2011, a young whale was found floating dead off the Greek island of Mykonos. Its stomach was so distended, biologists thought the animal swallowed a giant squid. However, when its four stomachs were dissected, nearly 100 plastic bags and other pieces of debris were found.

It should be noted that the plastic is not what killed the young male sperm whales. According to National Geographic, they died of heart failure. This was a result of mistakenly swimming into the North Sea, likely in search of squid, and then not being able to support their own body weights in the shallow water. As a result, their internal organs collapsed.

Regardless, the fact that many of their stomachs were full of pollution is a horrible indictment of humans. As has been reported in the past, 80% of the plastic which is discarded on land ends up in the oceans, where it is consumed by wildlife or swirls for years in great garbage patches. The fact that mankind – a species with a smaller brain than a whale – is responsible for such a travesty is ironic and saddening.

Until humans learn the value of living sustainably while respecting all life forms, travesties such as this one will continue to take place.

"This elegant model is combatting 'ageism' one photoshoot at a time.

In recent months, a number of activists have proven that just because one is growing older doesn’t mean they need to kiss their good looks, happiness, and vibrancy goodbye. From “China’s Hottest Grandfather” to mature swimsuit model Yazemeenah Rossi, these folks are proving that age is but a number, and that good dietary and lifestyle habits will serve one even into their later years.

Rossi, especially, has captured worldwide attention because she’s not like most swimsuit models in the fact that her portraits are not hyper-sexualized. In fact, this is what the Malibu, California, resident was intending when she collaborated with online shop The Dreslyn and a lingerie house called Land of Women for the collection.

The 61-year-old is the epitome of grace and beauty, and Dreslyn founder Brooke Taylor Corcia had similar to say about the model. According to Huffington Post, the entrepreneur wanted the simple yet raw collection to draw focus to women and their identities, rather than objectify their bodies.

“This is a woman who radiates health and vitality,” Corcia said. “She’s confident, she’s a visual artist, she takes care of herself. [This line is] all about being a person who’s well-lived and well-traveled and has intelligence and confidence, and letting that shine through.”

To appear as healthy as she does at her age, Rossi reportedly eats high-quality foods that aren’t sprayed with pesticides. She once told The Sunday Times:

“There is no big secret. All I have ever done is eat organic food – long before it became trendy.” “I take oil and use it on my skin. I put rapeseed oil on my hair. I scrub my skin once a week with olive oil and fine sugar, and I eat an avocado a day and organic meat and fish,” she added.

The following images are part of the Land of Women x The Dreslyn swimwear collection which is currently available online.

"The spill is one of the largest in North Dakota history.

A farmer in North Dakota discovered one of the largest crude oil spills ever recorded in the state just “bubbling up out of the ground” while harvesting wheat.

Farmer Steve Jensen stated that he smelled the crude oil a few days before his combines were covered in it. The oil was “spewing and bubbling six inches high,” he said in an interview with CBS News. The Tesoro Corp’s underground pipeline spilled 20,600 barrels of oil under the farmland. It was four times the size of a pipeline that burst in March of 2013 that forced the evacuation of more than 20 homes in Arkansas.

Luckily for the general population of North Dakota, however, the pipeline is in a remote corner in the northwest The nearest home is half a mile away, and there have been no water contamination reports. No animals or people have been injured in the spill.

Tesoro Logistics released a statement that the affected portion of the pipeline has been shut down.

“Protection and care of the environment are fundamental to our core values, and we deeply regret any impact to the landowner,” Tesoro CEO Greg Goff said in a statement. “We will continue to work tirelessly to fully remediate the release area.”

The company estimates it will cost about $4 million for clean up, and that “it is completely contained and under control” due to a natural layer of clay that is 40 feet thick underneath the oil spill site that has kept it from contaminating the water.

Eric Haugstad, Tesoro’s Director of Contingency Planning and Emergency Response has said there was a quarter-inch thick hole in the 20-year-old steel pipeline, which runs 35 miles from Tioga to a railroad facility near the Canadian border. The company is investigating possible causes.

Wayde Schafer, a North Dakota spokesman for The Sierra Club, said the spill is an example of the lack of oversight in a state that has exploded with oil development in recent years.

“We need more inspectors and more transparency,” Schafer said. “Not only is the public not informed, but agencies don’t appear to be aware of what’s going on and that’s not good.”

Unfortunately for the farmer, his field will be unable to be used now for multiple years.

"The difference between these photos is unsettling but really, not shocking.

Despite efforts being made to equalize the workplace for both men and women, the world of politics largely remains a male-dominated environment. To highlight this disparity, the ELLE UK magazine removed all the men in the pictures of politicians, leaving the meeting rooms and assemblies looking a bit deserted.

“The story of how women in positions of strength continually support and empower each other is consistently ignored while the myth that we pit ourselves against each other perpetuates,” reads the #MoreWomen campaign page on Elle. “We want to change this narrative in our feminism issue and create a more positive conversation – to reflect the power of women, and to support and grow each other as we push for global equality.”

"The Bike Washing Machine encourages you to conserve energy and get fit while completing household tasks.

Chores, chores, chores. Some days, it feels like the list is never-ending, and the motivation to accomplish the mundane tasks depleted.

But now, thanks to an invention designed by students in China, you can check exercise and laundry washing off your to-do list.

The Bike Washing Machine (or BiWa, as the students have dubbed it) is a human-powered washing machine that encourages you to multitask and conserve water while boosting your fitness in a fun, efficient way.

The innovative bike – which has not yet hit markets – was designed by students at Dalian Nationalities University in China.

The pedals help spin and rotate the front wheel, which is actually a clothing drum. And, any excess energy created by burning off calories is used to power a display screen that keeps the cyclist aware of the wash cycle’s progress.

When your kids or your hubby have excess energy to burn off, have them cycle, too, as excess energy can be stored for a subsequent use.

The most common complaint today is that people just ‘don’t have enough time.’ This neat invention not only frees up extra minutes, it inspires you to get active while completing household chores.



And, for college students and families on a budget, the bike can save money long-term as there are fewer trips to the laundromat as well as less time spent trekking across town.

"Coke is the most valuable brand in history, and “Coca-Cola” is the world’s second-most recognized word after “hello.” However, the beverage itself is an absolute poison to the human metabolism. Coke is very close to the acidity level of battery acid and, consequently, it can clean surfaces equivalent to and often better than many toxic household cleaners.

It’s cheaper and easier to buy Coke in some third world countries than it is to access clean water. Coke uses “public relations propaganda” to convince consumers and entire nations that it is an “environmental company” when really it is linked to pollution, water shortages, and disease.

People who consume soft drinks such as Coke have a 48% increase in heart attack and stroke risk, compared to people who did not drink the sodas at all or did not drink them every day. A study published in the journal Respirology reveals that soft drink consumption is also associated with lung and breathing disorders including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The carbonation in Coke causes calcium loss in the bones through a 3-stage process:

The carbonation irritates the stomach. The stomach “cures” the irritation the only way it knows how. It adds the only antacid at its disposal: calcium. It gets this from the blood. The blood, now low on calcium, replenishes its supply from the bones. If it did not do this, muscular and brain function would be severely impaired.

But, the story doesn’t end there. Another problem with most Coke is it also contain phosphoric acid (not the same as the carbonation, which is carbon dioxide mixed with the water). Phosphoric acid also causes a draw-down on the body’s store of calcium.

So Coke softens your bones (actually, makes them weak and brittle) in 3 ways:

Carbonation reduces the calcium in the bones. Phosphoric acid reduces the calcium in the bones. The beverage replaces a calcium-containing alternative, such as milk or water. Milk and water are not excellent calcium sources, but they are sources.

Esophageal cancer was very rare two generations ago — now, it’s common. The basic mechanism works as follows:

Mechanical damage to cells is a huge risk factor for cancer. It’s why asbestos particles, for example, cause lung cancer. All soft drinks cause acid reflux (stomach acid rising up past the esophageal valve). This is more pronounced when the body is horizontal (as in sleeping), but the sheer volume of Coke and soft drinks consumed in the USA means the acid reflux is well past the danger point. Any time you ingest a gassy drink, you are going to get belching–and acid into the esophagus. How much is too much? The research doesn’t say where the limit is–it only shows that most of us are far, far, far past it. Stomach acid dissolves tissue — that’s its purpose. The stomach lining does not extend into the esophagus, so the lower esophagus gets damaged by acid far more frequently in soft drink users than in non-soft drink users. This results in a radical increase in cell mutations, along with a far higher level of free radicals.

20 Practical Uses For Coke

Coke acts as an acidic cleaner. The amount of acid in soda is enough to wear away at the enamel of your teeth, making them more susceptible to decay. In tests done on the acidity levels of soda, certain ones were found to have PH levels as low as 2.5. To put that into perspective, consider that battery acid has a pH of 1 and pure water has a pH of 7.

To prove Coke does not belong in the human body, here are 20 practical ways you can use Coke as a domestic cleaner:"
"Life Conservatives Criticize Michelle Obama For Bare Arms, Stay Silent On Melania Trump’s Nude Poses By

Trump's wife, possible future First Lady, receives no criticism for nude photoshoots while Michelle Obama is insulted for bare arms.

Since Michelle Obama first became the First Lady of the United States, criticism of basically everything about her has been rampant among right-wing voters with racist and sexist undertones. Among this criticism is the accusation that Mrs. Obama “doesn’t look or act” like a First Lady, apparently because of her sense of fashion, which includes sleeveless dresses.

In two famous interviews with Al Shapiro from NPR at Mitt Romney events in 2012, a Virginia voter Bobbie Lussier summed up how Republicans feel about Mrs. Obama’s image. She stated that, “I mean, can you imagine you know, Kennedys or the Bushes or anybody doing pushups on the floor? I mean you know. That’s just not a first lady.” Lussier further said, “They talk about more like her dresses and how she looks and stuff and her arms and whatever. […] You see her walking around in shorts, and you know, just real casual wear.”

So not only is it inappropriate for Michelle to wear sleeveless dresses to any functions or shorts when she’s on vacation in very hot locales, but she is criticized for doing push-ups and encouraging Americans to live a healthy lifestyle. Although Mrs. Obama is one of the smartest and most educated First Ladies of all time, she is constantly put down for her appearance by allegedly religious and conservative voters. Additionally, Jackie Kennedy herself, who was referenced by Lussier, also wore sleeveless dresses.

Melania Trump on the other hand, whose husband is the current front-runner for the Republican party, has received no criticism for not being a suitable future First Lady based on her appearance or history of racy photoshoots. This seems to indicate that the conservative voters were only criticizing Mrs. Obama not because it isn’t “First Lady-like” or because it goes against their conservative, religious views, but simply because she is a Democrat and maybe even because she’s African American and that in itself is not suitable.

Mrs. Trump, who is Donald Trump’s fourth wife, which also seems to have raised no concerns about how that may be a violation of the sanctity of marriage, is a supermodel with a portfolio filled with nude photos. Of course Melania can do whatever she pleases, as it is the 21st century and women should feel free to use their bodies as they see fit, but when it comes to the media silence on these photos and whether she would make an appropriate First Lady compared to Mrs. Obama’s exposed-arms scandal, it raises questions about the true intent of this criticism.

"These individuals and families are the real people behind our political corruption, our planet's destruction, and our economic enslavement. It's time the world learns their names.

With attention squarely focused on the criminality of politicians, particularly that of the US presidential candidates, it’s easy to overlook the people really responsible for all this chaos. Much of the US’ political landscape for over a hundred years, and arguably long before, has been controlled by a small minority of wealthy families and individuals with a specific agenda. Through political and economic machinations over the years, these groups and their minions have funded both sides of wars and profited from them. They own the corporations who pollute our planet and exploit us all. They own the banks which make us slaves to imaginary debt. They own the politicians and police forces that are meant to serve us, yet they seek to undermine us and our “democracy” at every turn. Regardless of where you live, the following people are working against all of us, seeking only to procure still more power and influence and control every aspect of our lives. It’s about time we learned their names.

The Rockefellers

The Rockefellers are arguably one of the most evil families in American history. J.D. Rockefeller, the US’ first billionaire, was responsible for monopolizing the American Medical establishment over 75 years ago, and led the campaign to discredit other natural remedies in favor of the pharmaceutical industry he helped to create. He and his descendants later funded the Tavistock Institute for Human Relations, which used Freudian techniques to influence the opinion of the masses. Graduates of this institute went on to assume leadership roles in mainstream media, the government, and corporations. David Rockefeller is the only surviving grandson of J.D. Rockefeller, and, as such, continues his family’s dark legacy by using his incredible personal wealth. He has openly admitted that his family’s long-standing plan has been to create a one world government controlled by elites saying:

“Some even believe [the Rockefellers] are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as ‘internationalists’, conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I’m proud of it.”

David Rockefeller has been instrumental in planning the advent of this “new world order” via his influence in the Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, and the Council of Foreign Relations.

Henry Kissinger

Henry Kissinger is a war criminal like no other, though some of his proteges – such as Hillary Clinton – have come close. Not surprisingly, he’s been one of David Rockefeller’s closest friends since 1954. Kissinger, while serving as Nixon’s Secretary of State, oversaw a bloody coup in Chile, an illegal bombing campaign in Cambodia, and millions dead in Vietnam. However, because of his insider connections to the military-industrial complex, Kissinger ended up being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, a decision so outrageous that several members of the Nobel committee resigned in protest. Though Kissinger no longer serves as secretary of state, he still wields enormous influence and works as a consultant for some of the biggest names in US and international politics. He has served as a mentor to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and has been largely influential in the development of the US’ system of perpetual war. His legacy is evident in the never-ending ‘War on Terror’, and in the extrajudicial killings of US citizens via the covert drone war.

Larry Summers

Larry Summers not be very well-known, but his influence has been substantial nonetheless. Summers was a key player in economic policy under Bill Clinton’s administration, serving various important positions within the US Treasury until becoming the Secretary of the Treasury in 1999. Summers, along with his mentor Robert Rubin, were responsible for deregulating the US banking system via the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act, making him more responsible than any other person for the economic crisis of 2008, as well as the economic crisis we are soon to face.

Not only that, Summers also conspired with a cabal of banker big-shots to deregulate the banks of the entire world. Summers and his cronies forced nearly every government in the world to sign the Financial Services Agreement, an addendum to the international trade agreements managed by the World Trade Organization. The only country that refused was Brazil, one of the few countries who avoided the worst of the 2008 crisis. Summers pushed all of this deregulation to make the bankers richer as the 2008 crisis was essentially a massive wealth transfer from the people to the bankers. With Summers still very influential in the US government, his work will only make the inequality divide in the US worse with time.

George Soros

George Soros is one of the most notorious billionaires in the world. Soros made it rich as a currency manipulator, famously making a billion dollars in one day by initiating a British financial crisis and betting on the outcome. During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Soros was accused by the Malaysian government of bringing down the nation’s currency through his insider trading activities. He did something similar in England, prompting Thailand to call him an “economic war criminal.” Yet, Soros is more well-known for his funding of political causes, as well as his machinations that helped lead to Europe’s refugee crisis. Soros has also been accused of rigging elections as he has strong ties to several of the companies which produce electronic voting machines. Many of these Soros-funded voting machines malfunction and even switch votes. Soros also pushes for a “one world government”, and has worked to erode American sovereignty as well as the sovereignty of other nations in pursuit of that goal.

The Rothschilds

Last but not least, we have the Rothschild family. The Rothschilds are arguably the richest family in the world and essentially own a majority of the world’s central banks – which are private institutions in most countries – as well as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The Rothschilds’ most well-known patriarch, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, once said:

“Give me control of a nation’s money and I care not who makes the laws.”

This has been the maxim of the Rothschild family ever since. The Rothschilds are also responsible for Zionism, a racist ideology opposed by many Jews, and the State of Israel, which has caused numerous wars in the Middle East in its short history and is responsible for the unbelievable suffering of the Palestinian people. With so much money and so much power, the Rothschilds have incredible amounts of influence in US and international politics, so much so that even Hillary Clinton has begged them forgiveness in leaked emails. This one family has the power to economically destroy any nation that doesn’t do what the Rothschilds want.

"The agrihood is located in Detroit, Michigan, and feeds thousands of families in the area. Children and adults can learn about sustainable agriculture when they take part in the food forest's development.

Have you ever contemplated the fact that humans are the only species on Earth that pays to live on the planet? This continues, despite the fact that there is presently more than enough resources to care for every citizen.

As a matter of fact, enough food is produced around the world to feed 10 billion people. However, because 70% of the mono crops which are grown are feed livestock intended for slaughter, a distribution problem exists. In effect, 795 million people go to bed hungry each evening.

Solving the conundrum of world hunger has been many peoples’ dream. Hopefully, it will be remedied within the next century or two. Perhaps one of the ways inspired activists will make this ambition a reality is to install more community gardens which can offer nutrient-dense food to local civilians for free!

If it sounds too good to be true, look no further than what has developed in Michigan. Inhabitat reports that in the city of Detroit – which is recognized as a location where many families are affected by economic imbalance, America’s first urban ‘Agrihood’ exists and it feeds approximately 2,000 households.

The Michigan Urban Farming Initiative (MUFI) is responsible for implementing the three-acre project. Two acres of the land is devoted to growing crops, such as fruits and vegetables, and the remaining one acre allows for a fruit orchard with 200 trees. Additionally, a sensory garden has been constructed for kids to experience and learn more about sustainable agriculture.

MUFI explains its project as an alternative neighborhood growth model which centers around urban agriculture. Co-founder and president of the non-profit, Tyson Gersh, explained in a statement:

“Over the last four years, we’ve grown from an urban garden that provides fresh produce for our residents to a diverse, agricultural campus that has helped sustain the neighborhood, attracted new residents and area investment.”

Volunteers are essential for MUFI to flourish. Reportedly, plans are in the works to construct a 3,200 square-foot Community Resource Center at the agrihood. The building will serve as a colorful headquarters and education center. Nearby, a health food cafe will also be built, and it will likely utilize crops grown in the urban food forest.

Every individual and family deserve to have abundant access to nutrient-dense, life-saving foods. Please like, comment on, and share this article if you think more cities need similar initiatives.

"Today, hundreds of veterans from across the United States took a knee and begged for forgiveness for crimes committed toward indigenous people in the name of the U.S. military.

A massive awakening is being realized, and it’s stemming from the Standing Rock protest camps located near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Since April, “water protectors” have been protesting the development of a four-state Dakota Access Pipeline.

Individuals in support of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, who believe the land is rightfully theirs due to an 1851 treaty, have been maced, tased, beaten with batons, shot with rubber bullets, and even sprayed down with water canons in freezing temperatures because they believe the DAPL’s construction will uproot burial ground and potentially contaminate the Missouri river.

Energy Transfer Partners insists that the pipeline is incredibly safe, but betting on “human error” has proven to be too much of a risk, which is why advocates for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe protest. This past weekend, over three thousand veterans arrived at the Sacred Stone camp to show their support for the indigenous peoples’ plight, as well as to help prepare activists for the cold winter.

Likely because of the veterans’ arrival – which was organized by Michael J. Wood, a former Baltimore police officer, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied an easement to the oil companies responsible for the $3.7 billion pipeline. Cheers erupted in the camp as word spread, but a statement by Energy Transfer Partners soon made it clear that construction of the DAPL will continue regardless of the Obama Administration’s interference.

As of now, a standoff continues between law enforcement workers and water protectors; those who are present at Standing Rock – and many more who intend to venture to North Dakota – are adamant that they are not going anywhere until the pipeline is rerouted.

With heartache and humility in the air, veterans led by Wesley Clark Jr. did something remarkable today. Hundreds of veterans gathered before tribal leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and begged for forgiveness for crimes committed toward indigenous people in the name of the U.S. military.

The ceremony, according to Redhawk’s Facebook post, was led by Arvol Looking Horse, Leonard Crow Dog, Phyllis Young, Ivan Looking Horse, and a number of other natives of Turtle Island.

https://www.facebook.com/1131347910264898/photos/a.1131354410264248.1073741826.1131347910264898/1188863801179975/?type=3&theater

Though many military personnel are in favor of the pipeline’s construction due to the potential boost it could offer the economy, others see it as another instance in which native Americans are being trampled upon within a two-hundred-year period. To attempt to ‘right’ the many wrongs of the past, the brave veterans asked for forgiveness.

According to Jon Eagle, who is the tribal historic preservation officer for the Standing Rock Sioux, Leksi Leonard Crow Dog – a Sioux spokesman – forgave the veteran military members present for the past actions of their government. In turn, he asked for forgiveness for the Battle of Big Horn – also known as Custer’s Last Stand – when Sioux warriors killed approximately 268 U.S. soldiers affiliated with the 7th Cavalry.

Redhawk wrote that they were “forgiven for actions taken to dehumanize the indigenous of this country, and a step towards solitary has been made.”

https://www.facebook.com/jon.eagle.sr/posts/1379580165399528

After the moving ceremony, the two groups made a unified call for world peace.

What’s happening at Standing Rock is no longer a fight between the indigenous and those employed by an affluent oil company. The uprising has morphed into a battle between those who understand that all life is connected and that by honoring the Earth, everyone benefits – especially future generations.

âI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,â Trump said in defense of his decision to destroy the planet. Apparently, he doesnât realize that Pittsburgh stands to lose just as much as Paris, or literally anywhere else on Earth for that matter.

MayorÂ Bill Peduto was quick to respond to Trumpâs nonsense:

The United States joins Syria, Nicaragua & Russia in deciding not to participate with worldâs Paris Agreement. Itâs now up to cities to lead â bill peduto (@billpeduto) June 1, 2017

Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton https://t.co/cibJyT7MAK â bill peduto (@billpeduto) June 1, 2017

As the Mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future. https://t.co/3znXGTcd8C â bill peduto (@billpeduto) June 1, 2017

Once again, Trump is simply incapable of comprehending even the most fundamental of concepts. But I suppose that is par for the course when you are talking about someone who never learned that science is real. A total of 194 countriesÂ are now part of the Paris deal. The U.S. joins only two other nations who have chosen not to sign on. And even among those, America is the only one to abstain for such absurd reasons. Syria was not part of the agreement because they have been trapped in a bloody civil way.Â Nicaragua, on the other hand, refused to be a part of the deal because they didnât think it went far enough.

Nancy Patton Mills, chairman of theÂ Allegheny County Democratic Committee, echoed Peduto.

And Anne Hidalgo,Â the mayor of Paris, joined in toÂ let Trump knew where she stood as well.

"Today, Donald Trump yanked us out of the Paris climate agreementâsomething we helped craft and onto which every country in the world but two signedâand the backlash has been swift and harsh. Heâs lost two members of his business council; mayors of blue-collar cities like Pittsburgh have blasted him even though he claims to have done this for them; world leaders have blown up at us; and even The Weather Channel has jumped on Trump.

The Weather Channel might be expected to do this because theyâre in the business of reporting and forecasting the weather, which is directly influenced by the climate. They also report on other natural events affected by the weather. So, to express their displeasure at Trumpâs completely idiotic move, theyâve done this to their front page:

Yeah. There isnât much we can add to that.

The idiots who are crowing over this decision, who actually believe that this will âmake America great again,â canât see past their own noses. They have no concept of how the world actually works outside their own bubbles. As such, they have no concept of how their pathetic bubbles are affected by things like climate change, and that ignorant and myopic view hurts us all.

Utah Senator Mike Lee said âwe donât want nations lecturing us,â like the petulant âyouâre not the boss of meâ schoolchild who doesnât want to cooperate on anything. Rand Paul called it âunfair,â while Paul Ryan called it âa raw deal.â Ted Cruz said that the Paris deal would have cost us too much without acknowledging the fact that the U.S. literally just gave up its position as world leader, and that climate change will cost us far more than the Paris agreement ever could have.

Meanwhile, world leaders are busy condemning us for Trumpâs stupidity. Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen called it âa sad day,â while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is âdeeply disappointed that the United States federal government has decided to withdraw from the Paris agreement.â

Italy, France and Germany released a joint statement blasting Trump over the idea that he can pull us out and then remake the agreement into something far more to his liking:

âWe deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies.â

French President Emmanuel Macron yelled at us separately, too:

âI tell you firmly tonight: We will not renegotiate a less ambitious accord. There is no way. Donât be mistaken on climate; there is no plan B because there is no planet B.â

And Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel shredded Trump on Twitter over this decision:

I condemn this brutal act against #ParisAccord @realDonaldTrump Leadership means fighting climate change together. Not forsaking commitment. â Charles Michel (@CharlesMichel) June 1, 2017

Here at home, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, Washington State Governor Jay Inslee and California Governor Jerry Brown announced that theyâre creating a United States Climate Alliance, in hopes that the states will abide by the Paris agreement in a direct âfuck youâ to Donald Trump:

If the administration wonât #ActOnClimate, the states will. Proud to join @JerryBrownGov and @GovInslee to form the US Climate Alliance. pic.twitter.com/X6L5PiCZBw â Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 1, 2017

President Obama called it âabsence of American leadership,â and said that the Trump administration has â[rejected] the future.â

In reference to Trumpâs disputed statement that he works for Pittsburgh, not Paris (Pittsburghâs mayor blasted him for that), Commander Scott Kelly, up on the International Space Station, had some harsh but true words for Trump, too:

Withdrawing from the #ParisAgreement will be devastating to our planet. Paris and Pittsburgh share the same environment after all. pic.twitter.com/QNO5vHtmEF â Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) June 1, 2017

Teslaâs Elon Musk and Disneyâs Bob Iger both announced that theyâre leaving Trumpâs presidential business council, and Musk is departing another council on which he served:

Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. â Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017

As a matter of principle, Iâve resigned from the Presidentâs Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal. â Robert Iger (@RobertIger) June 1, 2017

Even Goldman Sachs is upset about this! Their CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, tweeted for the very first time today, and shredded Trump over this decision too:

Todayâs decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.âs leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement â Lloyd Blankfein (@lloydblankfein) June 1, 2017

Trump will not get his glory for this. It wonât merely be delayed as we start seeing jobs pouring back into the country, or thousands of new jobs suddenly pop up in coal country as the coal companies realize they donât have to worry about the Paris agreement anymore. There will be no glory. And Republicans who scream about âAmerican exceptionalismâ no longer have justification to do so. The United States does not renege on its commitmentsâ¦except for when Donald Trump is in charge.

"George Michael was buried in a secret midnight service in an elaborate plot to conceal his HIV-positive status!

A frenzy erupted when the late pop star’s boyfriend, Fadi Fawaz, posted an eerie picture of a church on Instagram — leading fans to believe the Wham! star had been laid to rest.

George’s burial plans had been kept under wraps since a coroner declared he died a “natural death” at age 53 on Christmas Day 2016.

George Michael Death Secrets — ‘Suicide’ Posts Disappear!

But evidence uncovered by The National ENQUIRER showed the “Careless Whisper” singer’s wild lifestyle led to his deadly HIV-positive status!

George’s autopsy revealed the hit-maker suffered from dilated cardiomyopathy — a disease where the heart muscles dilate and grow progressively thinner — which is linked to the use of cocaine and amphetamines.

The cardiomyopathy was further complicated by myocarditis, a heart inflammation common in AIDS patients!

George’s family refused to divulge any burial details, but some believed the ceremony would be held on Mother’s Day in a chapel at London’s Highgate Cemetery.

Fadi’s photo was uploaded without a caption, leading fans to think they’d missed the event.

“They finally buried George Michael. I feel like crying all over again,” one fan posted."

One cause behind George's ""natural death"" at 53 was revealed to be a ""fatty liver"" — an ailment most commonly caused by chronic alcoholism. Sadly, the American Liver Foundation confirms that fatty liver disease can be reversed by simply giving up alcohol. But, as claimed by many insiders, the singer behind hits such as ""Faith"" and ""Father Figure"" refused to get help for his chronic drinking. Even then, George's friends were more concerned about his serious drug habit, now also revealed to have killed the pop star!"

Fadi Fawaz has been in the spotlight ever since finding the dead body of his pop-star loveron Christmas Day, 2016 — and now there are shocking charges that Fawaz has enjoyed his own X-rated fame! RadarOnline.com is reporting that George's longtime lover is also alleged to work regularly as porn actor ""Isaac Mazar."" That explains how a humble hairdresser ended up with one of the world's biggest singers, but there are still more unanswered questions!

Fawaz became a regular fixture in photos taken with George as the two began dating in 2009. That was the same year that Fadi lost another close friend who was also a big star in the UK. Stephen Gately had enjoyed his own success in the pop act Boyzone, before the formerly-closeted singer died from a heart episode at the age of 33.

FameFlynet FameFlynet Insiders told Radar that Fadi enjoyed fame as a gay porn star, also occasionally working as ""Isaac Makar."" There are plentiful pics of the porn star to be found online under both the name of Isaac and Fawaz's own name. But that isn't even the strangest twist to Fawaz's sudden new fame!

Getty Images Getty Images Steve Harvey — behind his mega-watt smile — is a vicious, evil monster stewing in a soup of dark and ugly secrets!

That’s the claim of sources in a bombshell investigation by The National ENQUIRER that uncovered what fans don't see on TV — Steve’s a serial cheater, a child abuser, a racist and a bigamist! The ENQUIRER also discovered the “Little Big Shots” host, 60, is so terrified his depraved split personality will be exposed that he’s degenerated into a recluse, surrounding himself with 'round-the-clock armed security — that costs a whopping $25,000 a month!

“Steve’s a prisoner in his own twisted world,” spilled one source. “He’s always on the edge. He’s paranoid, but power hungry, and desperately trying to manage and control everything around him. But it’s all starting to cave in. He’s never learned from his past mistakes, and for years he’s been trying to sweep his shady business, raging temper, cheating and disrespect under the carpet. But he’s burned so many bridges, and crossed so many people that it’s all starting to come home to roost!”

A once-loyal employee told The ENQUIRER the TV titan has morphed into a nightmare dictator of a boss, and he made life a living hell for the staff of his Chicago-based talk show. The ENQUIRER obtained an all-staff memo — described as “tyrannical” by an insider — sent by Steve’s assistant in August 2016 that warned employees to steer clear. “No stopping by or popping in. No one,” the memo warned. Steve even threatened: “My security team will stop everyone from standing at my door who have the intent to see or speak to me.”

The “Steve Harvey” show ended production in the Windy City in mid-May. His new show, simply titled “Steve,” premieres in Los Angeles in September. “Steve didn’t offer interviews to many Chicago people who have been with him since the beginning, and hurt lots of people who would move on their own to L.A. to be part of the new show,” the former employee dished. “Steve never even addressed the staff about it. He never said a word about them all losing their jobs. These are die-hard loyal staff members!”

Mary Lee Shackelford, Essie Berry, have also accused Steve of conning Mary out of millions of dollars in their divorce. The women claimed Steve — who has amassed a $100 million fortune with his media empire — worked with crooked lawyers who deceived Mary, and his team even forged her signature on official documents. The “Family Feud” host also treated his second wife, like dirt , insiders said. Mary accused Steve of cheating, blaming their 2005 separation for triggering her mental breakdown and suicide attempt. Mary and her pal, civil rights activist, have also accused Steve of conning Mary out of millions of dollars in their divorce. The women claimed Steve — who has amassed a $100 million fortune with his media empire — worked with crooked lawyers who deceived Mary, and his team even forged her signature on official documents.

Mary insisted: “Steve had the money and the power and he does what he wants! He wants me gagged because I know Steve Harvey has issues.” She also claimed Steve committed bigamy when he married current wife Marjorie in 2007 before their divorce was finalized!

The controlling TV mogul also snatched their son, Wynton (second from right), from Mary, and she claimed Steve denied her visitation from 2008 to 2013. Mary has also accused Steve of child abuse, claiming he brutally beat Wynton with a belt. According to a Plano, Texas, police report from October 2008: “Wynton stated that his father … whipped him with a belt and also a paddle board.” The investigating officer reported seeing bruises on Wynton’s right thigh and right buttocks, and a cut on his right thigh. Despite this, a rep for Steve said the Texas Dept. of Family and Protective Services [concluded] “the child does not appear to be at risk … the case is closed without further investigation.”

Getty Images Getty Images Meanwhile, the hypocrite has also bragged on air about sending Wynton and his adopted daughter, Lori, to college. But, according to a police report, Steve ordered his hulking ex-pimp bodyguard, “Boomerang,” to drag Wynton out of his dorm at Florida International University — in the middle of the night! The ENQUIRER has learned the media mogul ordered the kidnapping after hearing his son had popped off about Steve cheating on his wife! Wynton later denied being kidnapped, but a campus police report revealed he checked out of his room at 4 a.m. on Nov. 15, 2015, and his key was later returned by one of Steve’s assistants, who also withdrew Wynton from the school after just three months.

During a taping of “Family Feud” in Atlanta on March 17, The ENQUIRER caught Steve cruelly mocking his eldest son with first wife Marcia Harvey. When the cameras weren’t rolling, the deadbeat dad said: “I put all my kids through college, but my son is as dumb as a doughnut. I should ask his mother for a paternity test. “He’s 25 now though. I’m attached to him. I figure I may as well ride it out.”"
"This video begins as cops in Jupiter, Fla., are putting Woods in front of their patrol car — after finding his Mercedes ""stopped in the roadway in the right lane"" at 2:49 a.m. on May 29, 2017. “As I shined my flashlight into the passenger window of the vehicle,” an officer wrote in an official report, “the male slightly opened his eyes and started slowly moving his arms around [and] appeared to struggle finding the correct window button.” As seen here, the troubled golf star's behavior only got more bizarre."

The real-life Melanie was pregnant and had run off with a croupier, only to be found by her parents three weeks later.

Joan then got even by secretly wearing a weight belt for a scene where Bette, who had back problems, pulls her out of bed.

Files Files Joan made sure to keep flubbing her lines while shooting the scenes, which resulted in numerous takes and a crippling backache for Bette. But the fireworks between the Tinseltown stars originally ignited in 1935 during the filming of the melodrama “Dangerous.” Lead actress Bette fell madly in love with her tall, dark and handsome co-star Franchot Tone. Joan, however, already had her claws sunk into him — and the two were engaged before the film wrapped, infuriating Bette.

Files Files “She took him from me,” Bette fumed decades later. “She did it coldly, deliberately and with complete ruthlessness. I have never forgiven her for that, and never will!” The feud was fueled by their white-hot careers, as both won Best Actress Oscars. But theatrically-trained Bette always looked down on sexpot Joan as a shallow “glamour puss” who got by on her looks — and promiscuity!

Files Files Marlene Dietrich, “She slept with every male star at MGM, except Lassie,” Bette quipped about her rival. Actually, notoriously bisexual Joan also racked up an impressive list of female lovers, including Hollywood royalty like Greta Garbo Barbara Stanwyck and Marilyn Monroe . And her unrequited lust for Bette may have contributed to the grudge!

Files Files “Franchot isn’t interested in Bette, but I wouldn’t mind giving her a poke if I was in the right mood,” Joan once admitted. In the 1940s, the stars had adjoining dressing rooms at Warner Bros. and competed for the same parts. When Bette passed up the lead in “Mildred Pierce,” Joan took the role and won an Oscar — turning up the heat on their grudge."

"Mass murderer James Holmes long suffered from hallucinations, a mental health issue that runs in his family, Copycat Killers: The Dark Knight reveals.

“This wasn’t the family’s first exposure to mental health,” said J. Buzz Von Ornsteiner, Forensic Psychologist. “There were family members who did suffer from mental health issues.”

Holmes began to hear ferocious banging on his bedroom walls, which he called “nail ghosts.”

“It appears that these [hallucinations] were consistent as James grew up,” Ornsteiner added.

Getty Images Getty Images Music legend Clive Davis oversaw Whitney's career from the start — and the head of Arista Records was finally inspired to confront his hit artist after a humiliating turn onstage during a Michael Jackson tribute show on Sept. 7, 2001. Shocked fans saw that their beloved songbird was wasting away — as seen in the following photos...

Getty Images Getty Images ""Whitney's black dress looked like it was on a hanger,"" said one insider — and another eyewitness told The ENQUIRER: ""Her cheekbones protrude, and her arms and legs are as thin as bamboo canes!""

Getty Images Getty Images Clive was sickened by the pathetic performance, and wrote Whitney this heartbreaking letter: ""When I saw you Friday night at the Michael Jackson concert, I gasped. When I got home, I cried. My dear, dear Whitney, the time has come. Of course I know you don't want to hear this. Of course I know that you're saying that Clive is being foolishly dramatic. Of course I know that your power of denial is in overdrive dismissing everything I and everyone else is saying to you!""

Getty Images Getty Images Janis Joplin. ""You need help and it must begin now. I will stand by you with love and caring to see you through it to newfound peace and happiness in every way as a woman, as a mother, as a role model to inspire the rest of the world."" ""I join your mother in pleading with you to face up to the truth now, right now, and there is no more time or postponement,"" added Clive — whose long career had outlasted other doomed stars like. ""You need help and it must begin now. I will stand by you with love and caring to see you through it to newfound peace and happiness in every way as a woman, as a mother, as a role model to inspire the rest of the world.""

Getty Images Getty Images Amazingly, Clive's letter almost worked — with The ENQUIRER reporting in Sept. 2004 that Whitney was on her way to a comeback! The triumphant diva had made a stunning appearance at the World Music Awards in Las Vegas, as pictured here.

Getty Images Getty Images ""She has rededicated herself to her family and career,"" said an insider, ""and the effects of her new attitude are obvious. She is the happiest we've seen her in a long, long time!""

Getty Images Getty Images The album ""Just Whitney"" had been released in Dec. 2002, and overcame mixed reviews to return her to the spotlight — but by May 2006, The ENQUIRER was reporting that Whitney was back in rehab. A fellow Atlanta crack addict named Tina had told reporters about her time binging on drugs with the former superstar!

Getty Images Getty Images ""She sees demons when she's high,"" said Tina . ""She'll point to the floor and say, 'See that demon. I'm telling you, somebody's messing with Bobby [Brown]!' She always thinks it got something to do with Bobby!""

Getty Images Getty Images Tragically, her stint in rehab was a disaster, and Whitney was back to feeding her addictions by 2007. Pals told The ENQUIRER: ""Whitney cannot afford another drug setback!""

Getty Images Getty Images O.J. Simpson was arrested on Feb. 1, 1989, after he allegedly punched, slapped and kicked his pretty blonde wife Nicole during a violent argument at their home. The National ENQUIRER had the full story years before O.J. was arrested for Nicole's murder in 1994 — and reported at the time on how Simpson was worried that the assault case would spell the end of his career. ""The news of O.J.'s alleged violence couldn't have come at a worse time professionally for him,"" said a Hollywood insider.

YouTube YouTube The industry spy revealed that some major Hollywood names were furious over the charges made against Simpson — and that they believed his battered wive (pictured her in a police report). ""He and Erik Estrada were to costar in a new series, 'Hunks,' playing retired pro athletes who become private detectives,"" said the source. ""O.J. had a February 3 meeting scheduled with producers and network officials to discuss 'Hunks.' But after the story broke on February 2 about his vicious row with his wife, the meeting was canceled that afternoon!"" But, sadly, there were plenty more Hollywood insiders who kept embracing O.J.!

Splash News Splash News Of course, Kris Jenner and her new husband Bruce were thrilled to remain good friends with The Juice — even as Kris also maintained her friendship with Nicole. The ENQUIRER has already revealed how insiders now claim that Kris might very well have helped O.J. hide evidence that would have convicted him for Nicole's murder.

Splash News Splash News Kris had been married to attorney Robert Kardashian when Simpson was arrested for both assaulting Nicole and later murdering her. Robert had also helped his pal put together the Dream Team of lawyers who got the NFL star off the hook in 1995. Shortly after his arrest for Nicole's murder, Robert — who passed away in 2003 — read a statement from O.J. that implied Nicole had assaulted him after an earlier visit by the police, and added: ""I took the heat New Year's 1989 because that's what I was supposed to do.""

Getty Images Getty Images Nicole supposedly forgave her husband, and the couple remained married until 1992 — but her nightmare of abuse wouldn't end! There were still plenty of star-struck celebs happy to keep hanging with O.J. The football star was even hosted by the wife of New York City mayor David Dinkins for a 1991 charity event!

Simpson was also always welcome on the celebrity golf circuit — where he often was seen palling around with lovely Hawaiian Tropic models, as seen in this photo from the 1992 Mexico Celebrity Sports Invitational Tournament.

Getty Images Getty Images Stars like Larry Hagman and Peter Fonda were also proud to hang with Simpson at the October 1993 opening of the Harley Davidson Cafe in New York City!

Getty Images Getty Images Charges of spousal abuse didn't keep NBC Sports from keeping Simpson as a football correspondent — although that ultimately embarrassed the network. Video even caught the sports reporter on the sidelines wearing the Bruno Magli shoes that left prints at the crime scene, and that he denied ever owning!

Corbis Corbis NBC also hired Simpson to star in a made-for-TV movie called ""Frogmen"" — but a planned series never happened after O.J. was arrested before the fall television season of 1994. The completed film ended up being confiscated by the police, and there were theories that Simpson's training to play a Navy S.E.A.L. could have helped him kill Nicole more efficiently!

YouTube YouTube Simpson kept working as an occasional guest star on the HBO series ""1st & Ten"" after his arrest for domestic violence — although that caused some controversy within the network. ""We were asked to book O.J. as a guest star on our show for HBO,"" said a former producer for the pay network. ""We got the impression that it was expected of us, but there were some female producers on our staff who threatened to take it to the newspapers if they were forced to work with O.J.!""

YouTube YouTube Sadly, the producers and cast of the ""Naked Gun"" series were still willing to bring back Simpson as the bumbling Detective Nordberg for two more movies after the actor's arrest in 1989. Series producer David Zucker was unrepentant, though, and even wanted O.J. in a fourth ""Naked Gun"" movie. ""Yeah, I think we did have an idea,"" David recalled. ""It involved Nordberg claiming that his wife was killed, and he was going to search for the killer...That’s what we would have done, but I don’t think Paramount wanted to reboot it. Everybody’s so scared."""

"Police work’s unexpected perils were on display in south central Pennsylvania Sunday morning, where a cop got a crippling snout-full of drugs during a routine search of a suspect’s car!

Two officers from Washington Township responded to the scene of a one-car accident 12:30 a.m. Sunday, and suspected that the crashed vehicle’s operator — Travis Ross (right), 34, of Leechburg, Penn. — was under the influence of alcohol. The officers’ report claims that Ross, who resisted arrest, told them that his I.D. was in the center console of his vehicle.

When the officer popped open the console, a powdery substance that police say was either heroin or fentanyl wafted out into his face. Almost immediately he found his heartbeat racing, felt a burning in his chest, and fell to his knees in the roadway.

Emergency medical technicians, who had been summoned to the scene even before the cop’s cloud encounter, administered the overdose-intervention drug Narcan before rushing him to the local hospital. He was released later that morning and is expected to be okay.

BACKGRID BACKGRID Antonio Banderas cleaned himself up for the Cannes Film Festival — ditching a scruffy beard while showing off his recovery from a January heart attack!

BACKGRID BACKGRID The ex-husband of Melanie Griffith was moving on with his life, accompanied by his young love Nicole Kimpel and lining up plenty of new acting roles at the movie industry gathering! The National ENQUIRER revealed in March 2017 that the ""Zorro"" star had suffered a second secret heart attack horror — and had rushed to a secret clinic in Switzerland in a bid to save his life!

BACKGRID BACKGRID The star flew into Geneva on a private jet with Nicole Kempel — using a false identity to register at the exclusive Nescens Clinique 18 miles away in Genolier. The super-exclusive facility provides expert plastic surgery procedures, as well as cutting-edge stem-cell replacement therapy not available in the United States.

BACKGRID BACKGRID “Antonio doesn’t want to frighten anyone, so he’s downplaying his health problems,” spilled a source — but he looked dashing and ready for a leading man role in Cannes. Insiders tell The ENQUIRER that's partly because Antonio was finally inspired to give up cigarettes!

BACKGRID BACKGRID “If there is something good that came from all of this,” confirmed Antonio (here with Nicole and her twin sister), “it is that I suddenly stopped smoking, without needing pills or anything like that. It’s over!"

Getty Images Getty Images “Empire” star Gabourey Sidibe admits she was trapped in a nightmare of constant vomiting and diet pills — while indulging in food binges with Crystal Light and Chips Ahoy cookies!

Getty Images Getty Images Those are the shocking — and heartbreaking — revelations to come from an explosive tell-all the tragically obese 34-year-old penned, and which was obtained by The National ENQUIRER . “Throwing up made me feel high,” Gabby confessed in the emotional pages. “I felt a release around my head like a halo that made me feel lighter physically and emotionally.”

Getty Images Getty Images In the book — called “This Is Just My Face: Try Not to Stare” — the 2010 Oscar nominee for ""Precious"" admitted she began gobbling sweets as a child, and her mom gave her diet pills. “But I’d learned that you can actually eat when you’re not hungry,” wrote the Oscar- nominated actress. “If I had a bad day at school, munching Chips Ahoy cookies while watching cartoons was a great way to elevate my mood.”

Getty Images Getty Images Gabby’s father fed her SlimFast shakes, but “I drank the shakes along with some chips while watching TV,” she wrote. In high school, Gabby tried “diets where I would only eat packs of ramen noodles and only drink Crystal Light.” Then she began skipping meals. “I never ate breakfast to begin with, and now I gave up lunch completely, too,” she penned. As a college sophomore, Gabby suffered from depression and panic attacks that triggered a three-year battle with bulimia."

Getty Images Getty Images Clarence Thomas is tangled up in a shocking new sex scandal! The Supreme Court Justice now faces claims that he was into video porn, raunchy bedroom romps and kinky threesomes with women staffers from his office! The explosive claims come from a bombshell exclusive Lillian McEwen — a former administrative law judge who says she was Thomas’ mistress for six or seven years! is tangled up in a shocking new sex scandal! The Supreme Court Justice now faces claims that he was into video porn, raunchy bedroom romps and kinky threesomes with women staffers from his office! The explosive claims come from a bombshell exclusive National ENQUIRER interview with— a former administrative law judge who says she was Thomas’ mistress for six or seven years!

Getty Images Getty Images Her stunning X-rated charges are sure to rock the reputation of Thomas, who was approved for the nation’s highest court by the U.S. Senate in 1991 — despite shocking testimony by lawyer Anita Hill claiming he sexually harassed her. Lilian talked to The ENQUIRER and made shocking claims that reveal the right-wing jurist, 67, was even into sex clubs, threesomes and other twisted stuff!

Getty Images Getty Images “He was always ready for sex,” said Lillian. “I went with him several times to Plato’s Retreat, the New York swingers club [pictured]. We had sex with each other there and with the people we went with. He recruited women he worked with for threesomes with us!”

Getty Images Getty Images Anita Hill (pictured) also worked with Thomas. He was her boss at the U.S. Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Anita — now a Law Professor at Brandeis University — testified that Thomas continually made sexual advances, and frequently made smutty remarks to her. She claimed that he talked about porn movie actor Long Dong Silver in one conversation, and once asked: “Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?”

Getty Images Getty Images Thomas denied any inappropriate behavior after Anita's testimony. Lillian said that she also offered to testify about the “real Clarence” at his Senate confirmation hearings, but then-Judiciary Committee chairman Joe Biden never replied.

Getty Images Getty Images Lillian also said Thomas was a big boozer. “When I met him he was a functioning alcoholic,” Lillian says. He liked to “drink pretty much anything that had alcoholic content.” Lillian dated Thomas when he separated from his first wife. She wrote about their raunchy hijinks in a 2011 memoir titled “DC Unmasked & Undressed.”

Getty Images Getty Images The judge later married second wife Virginia, a conservative lobbyist, in 1987. She's seen here at his side during the confirmation hearings. Lillian claimed that the future Supreme Court Justice cleaned up his act shortly after his wedd."

After winning 14 major tournaments and dominating golf for more than a decade, Tiger lost his mojo after his marriage to Swedish beauty Elin Nordegren blew up in a 2009 sex scandal.

After that, “Tiger’s injuries began to pile up,” said the source.

"“Roseanne”, one of the most successful ’90s TV comedies, is making a comeback — but the joyful reunion will be over-shadowed by a dark tragedy!

The blue-collar family sitcom, featuring Roseanne Barr, John Goodman and Sara Gilbert, will be missing one of its brightest stars: Glenn Quinn.

The Irish actor — who played “Mark Healy”, the tough-guy hubby of Roseanne’s TV daughter “Becky” — tragically died in 2002 of a heroin overdose at 32.

Glenn had made a bundle while working on the show, but after getting hooked on booze and drugs, he lost it all!

During his sad last days, the homeless junkie had been crashing on a friend’s couch — which was where his lifeless body was found.

Roseanne To Amy Schumer: Revive My Career!

The handsome, green-eyed Irishman starred on Roseanne from 1990 to 1997, and earned enough cash to buy a posh home in the Hollywood Hills, drive a Mercedes-Benz and own a share of an L.A. rock club.

“He lost everything because of his addictions to booze, coke and heroin,” said a source close to Glenn.

The actor’s ugly end devastated Roseanne.

“Everyone in the cast and crew loved Glenn,” Roseanne said shortly after his death. “We adored him.”

“Glenn’s death casts a pall over the new show,” confided an insider who worked on the show."

“Cait’s got her heart set on finding the perfect man to date and Yusaf ticks every box,” an insider blabbed to The ENQUIRER.

The only hitch — Cait is 67 and he’s 37.

Still, the former man known as Bruce Jenner has been bombarding the slugger with messages to link up."
"Addicting Info started as a resource to discredit all the lies and propaganda that the right-wing spreads. When I undertook the project I thought I would probably have about 100 different articles about a number of different myths, and people could sort through them at will. Eventually that expanded to news and other info, and I quickly realized the DAUNTING task of actually trying to discredit EVERY right-wing myth that is in existence, especially with the constant creation of new ones.

Now, I look for people who seem to have a similar goal in mind, whether they have realized it or not, and recruit them to join Addicting Infoâs team. Iâm very pleased to say that weâve assembled an incredible team of writers.

"The reaction to Trumpâs withdrawing us from the Paris climate agreement was swift and harsh, but one of the harshest reactions came from The Weather Channel, which put the ignoramuses who supported Trump in this disaster in their place."

The amateur presidentâs approval rating after the first 100 days in office is historically low â the lowest number at that point in a presidency ever recorded by pollsters.
There is a special place in hell for media outlets that âtry and manipulate the legacy of a murder victim in order to forward their own political agenda.â
It may not be a comfortable truth to face but Trumpâs support comes from the same kind of fear and anger that keeps the Middle East in perpetual war.
"If any of these challenges has ever made sense, this one sure does."
"The mayor of Pittsburgh had a few choice words for Donald Trump after he used the city as a reason to abandon the Paris Climate Agreement.

âI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,â Trump said in defense of his decision to destroy the planet. Apparently, he doesnât realize that Pittsburgh stands to lose just as much as Paris, or literally anywhere else on Earth for that matter.

MayorÂ Bill Peduto was quick to respond to Trumpâs nonsense:

The United States joins Syria, Nicaragua & Russia in deciding not to participate with worldâs Paris Agreement. Itâs now up to cities to lead â bill peduto (@billpeduto) June 1, 2017

Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton https://t.co/cibJyT7MAK â bill peduto (@billpeduto) June 1, 2017

As the Mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future. https://t.co/3znXGTcd8C â bill peduto (@billpeduto) June 1, 2017

Once again, Trump is simply incapable of comprehending even the most fundamental of concepts. But I suppose that is par for the course when you are talking about someone who never learned that science is real. A total of 194 countriesÂ are now part of the Paris deal. The U.S. joins only two other nations who have chosen not to sign on. And even among those, America is the only one to abstain for such absurd reasons. Syria was not part of the agreement because they have been trapped in a bloody civil way.Â Nicaragua, on the other hand, refused to be a part of the deal because they didnât think it went far enough.

Nancy Patton Mills, chairman of theÂ Allegheny County Democratic Committee, echoed Peduto.

And Anne Hidalgo,Â the mayor of Paris, joined in toÂ let Trump knew where she stood as well.

"Sean Hannity needs a safe space because he canât take a joke.

For months, the deplorable Fox News host who has been attacking a dead man named Seth Rich in defense of his good buddy Donald Trump has been referring to liberals as âsnowflakesâ because they are offended by the things Trump has done.

Well, after months of using the term to attack liberals, Hannity committed hypocrisy by whining about an article published by The Onion, a well-known satire publication.

Hannity posted the piece on Twitter complaining about how âthe leftâ¦think these sorts of things are funny.â

The article Hannity is complaining about features Roger Ailesâ corpse and how a bunch of mini Sean Hannitys burst out of his body. You know, because Hannity is a parasitic nightmare.

What is wrong with the left that they think these sorts of things are funny? https://t.co/sAxON5xxmh â Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) June 1, 2017

Again, this is satire. Itâs what The Onion does best. And they donât just make fun of conservatives either. They make fun of everyone and everything.

But Hannity couldnât handle it because unlike liberals, he is a true snowflake and a hypocrite. And Twitter users mocked him to oblivion for it.

Itâs simple: you remind the writer of a parasitic symbiote that fed on the corpse of the rapist who ran your soon-to-be-former network home â Charles Bramesco (@intothecrevasse) June 1, 2017

Dude itâs The Onion. â Steve Schreiber (@sschreiber13) June 1, 2017

This is so offensive. The only recently fresh corpse Sean Hannity would ever desecrate belongs to Seth Rich. â Jon Bershad (@JonBershad) June 1, 2017

Sean did you read their story about the dog speaking at a recent graduation ceremony? Itâs outrageous. https://t.co/U9lpvHUbKh â Ben K. (@benyankee) June 1, 2017

Since when is @TheOnion part of the left? They lampoon stupidity. If they are lampooning you, find a mirror. â (((Ryan Wagman))) (@RAWagman) June 1, 2017

Whatâs really funny is all the traffic youâre sending toward @TheOnion with this tweet. Itâs like you want to make them some money. â Joshua Guess (@JoshuaGuess) June 1, 2017

I think itâs hysterical, snowflake â Bradley Herring (@BEHdc) June 1, 2017

Aw, snowflake Sean has been triggered by a satirical publication. â Drumpf Micropenis (@Dons_Angry_Inch) June 1, 2017

You need a safe space? â Morty Heureuse (@BNick) June 1, 2017

The fact that you donât know this is a parody website is so hilarious and shows how terrible your research âskillsâ really are. â Sam Geden (@KaisaJesta) June 1, 2017

Once again, Sean Hannity just got his ass handed to him. Now we just need to wait for him to whine about that like the snowflake he is.

"The Morning Joe panel couldnât contain their laughter this morning after Joe Scarborough made a hilarious observation about Donald Trump.

Despite the fact that Trump is 70 years old, Scarborough couldnât help but compare Trumpâs behavior to that of a toddler.

As the panel discussed Trumpâs âcovfefeâ boondoggle, Mika Brzezinski reminded Scarborough about something he said before the program.

âI think you said something before the show that really kind of summed it up,â she began. âLike a kid pooping their pants and then saying I meant to do that!â

Indeed, Trumpâs imaginary new word has been on top of the news for days now and even Sean Spicer was forced to defend it by saying that Trump meant to say it. Even dictionary publishers are having a hard time with it.

And Scarboroughâs comparison was absolutely perfect.

âYes, it would be like somebody pooping their pants and people looking at it saying, âThatâs modern art, donât you understand?ââ Scarborough said. ââI am making a statement against Russian aggression in Crimea, and so this is my statement, and if you donât get it somethingâs wrong with you and not me.ââ

The panelists couldnât contain their laughter, but Scarborough wasnât done yet. Itâs not enough that Trump is constantly shitting himself. Heâs also sitting in it and making everyone around him sit in it, too.

âIâm going to make another statement and Iâm going to sit down in my pants, and it will then be modern art and I will hang it on your wall,â Scarborough continued. âThatâs what âcovfefe,â if anybody wants to know, that small group knows what âcovfefeâ is â poopy pants. He does a verbal version of that every day, but itâs not just him. Unfortunately now Donald Trump has people doing that rhetorically in their pants every day.â

Hereâs the video via VidMe.

Donald Trump has been shitting himself every day since Election Day. He couldnât even stop shitting himself when he went abroad to the Middle East and Europe. He embarrassed America every day during that trip and then he came home and shit himself again. Trump is pathetic and he needs to be booted out of office along with anyone who supports him. Presidents should not be able to smear the red, white, and blue with shit and get away with it.

"Donald Trump continues to find even more ways to fail and fall back on all of the ridiculous promises he made during his presidential campaign â all while managing to piss off the rest of the world and cut ties with Americaâs allies.

Trump proved himself even more incompetent on Thursday, when he broke another campaign promise by granting a six-month waiver for a law that would move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. During his presidential campaign, Trump had sworn up and down that he would relocate the embassy âfair quicklyâ after he got into the White House and began his term. Like many of his other empty campaign promises, we are still waiting.

According to the Associated Press:

âTrump was facing a Thursday deadline to renew the waiver or see the State Department lose half its funding for its overseas facilities. Presidents of both parties have renewed the waiver every six months for years.â

This could not have pissed offÂ Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu more, especially right after Trump already disrespected the Middle Eastern country during his first trip overseas, when he outed Israel as the source for his intelligence leak to Russia. After Trump issued this waiver, Netanyahu expressed his disappointment in a statement that was posted to Twitter:

Statement by the Prime Ministerâs Office pic.twitter.com/xP1FZ1vrZf â PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) June 1, 2017

Trumpâs presidency is turning out to be nothing like what his supporters and the Republican Party thought it would be. Even those who were against him are taken back by how awful itâs actually turning out to be. Heâs only a few months into his first (and only) term, and already most of TrumpâsÂ campaign promises have crumbled. Even the ones heâs tried to follow through with have been massive failures. Can we really take three and a half more years of this?!

"Today, Donald Trump yanked us out of the Paris climate agreementâsomething we helped craft and onto which every country in the world but two signedâand the backlash has been swift and harsh. Heâs lost two members of his business council; mayors of blue-collar cities like Pittsburgh have blasted him even though he claims to have done this for them; world leaders have blown up at us; and even The Weather Channel has jumped on Trump.

The Weather Channel might be expected to do this because theyâre in the business of reporting and forecasting the weather, which is directly influenced by the climate. They also report on other natural events affected by the weather. So, to express their displeasure at Trumpâs completely idiotic move, theyâve done this to their front page:

Yeah. There isnât much we can add to that.

The idiots who are crowing over this decision, who actually believe that this will âmake America great again,â canât see past their own noses. They have no concept of how the world actually works outside their own bubbles. As such, they have no concept of how their pathetic bubbles are affected by things like climate change, and that ignorant and myopic view hurts us all.

Utah Senator Mike Lee said âwe donât want nations lecturing us,â like the petulant âyouâre not the boss of meâ schoolchild who doesnât want to cooperate on anything. Rand Paul called it âunfair,â while Paul Ryan called it âa raw deal.â Ted Cruz said that the Paris deal would have cost us too much without acknowledging the fact that the U.S. literally just gave up its position as world leader, and that climate change will cost us far more than the Paris agreement ever could have.

Meanwhile, world leaders are busy condemning us for Trumpâs stupidity. Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen called it âa sad day,â while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is âdeeply disappointed that the United States federal government has decided to withdraw from the Paris agreement.â

Italy, France and Germany released a joint statement blasting Trump over the idea that he can pull us out and then remake the agreement into something far more to his liking:

President Obama called it âabsence of American leadership,â and said that the Trump administration has â[rejected] the future.â

In reference to Trumpâs disputed statement that he works for Pittsburgh, not Paris (Pittsburghâs mayor blasted him for that), Commander Scott Kelly, up on the International Space Station, had some harsh but true words for Trump, too:

Teslaâs Elon Musk and Disneyâs Bob Iger both announced that theyâre leaving Trumpâs presidential business council, and Musk is departing another council on which he served:

Even Goldman Sachs is upset about this! Their CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, tweeted for the very first time today, and shredded Trump over this decision too:

Trump will not get his glory for this. It wonât merely be delayed as we start seeing jobs pouring back into the country, or thousands of new jobs suddenly pop up in coal country as the coal companies realize they donât have to worry about the Paris agreement anymore. There will be no glory. And Republicans who scream about âAmerican exceptionalismâ no longer have justification to do so. The United States does not renege on its commitmentsâ¦except for when Donald Trump is in charge.

"Today, Donald Trump yanked us out of the Paris climate agreementâsomething we helped craft and onto which every country in the world but two signedâand the backlash has been swift and harsh. Heâs lost two members of his business council; mayors of blue-collar cities like Pittsburgh have blasted him even though he claims to have done this for them; world leaders have blown up at us; and even The Weather Channel has jumped on Trump.

The Weather Channel might be expected to do this because theyâre in the business of reporting and forecasting the weather, which is directly influenced by the climate. They also report on other natural events affected by the weather. So, to express their displeasure at Trumpâs completely idiotic move, theyâve done this to their front page:

Yeah. There isnât much we can add to that.

The idiots who are crowing over this decision, who actually believe that this will âmake America great again,â canât see past their own noses. They have no concept of how the world actually works outside their own bubbles. As such, they have no concept of how their pathetic bubbles are affected by things like climate change, and that ignorant and myopic view hurts us all.

Utah Senator Mike Lee said âwe donât want nations lecturing us,â like the petulant âyouâre not the boss of meâ schoolchild who doesnât want to cooperate on anything. Rand Paul called it âunfair,â while Paul Ryan called it âa raw deal.â Ted Cruz said that the Paris deal would have cost us too much without acknowledging the fact that the U.S. literally just gave up its position as world leader, and that climate change will cost us far more than the Paris agreement ever could have.

Meanwhile, world leaders are busy condemning us for Trumpâs stupidity. Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen called it âa sad day,â while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is âdeeply disappointed that the United States federal government has decided to withdraw from the Paris agreement.â

Italy, France and Germany released a joint statement blasting Trump over the idea that he can pull us out and then remake the agreement into something far more to his liking:

âWe deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies.â

French President Emmanuel Macron yelled at us separately, too:

"The reaction to Trumpâs withdrawing us from the Paris climate agreement was swift and harsh, but one of the harshest reactions came from The Weather Channel, which put the ignoramuses who supported Trump in this disaster in their place."
"While the Trump administration is up to its collective neck in scandals, Donald Trump just exempted his entire senior staff from provisions of his own ethics rules, thus giving any conflicts of interest a pass. The ethics waivers total more than five times the number granted in the first four months of the Obama administration. This move follows an intense dispute betweenÂ the White House and the Office of Government Ethics, which had been pushing the Trump administration to stop granting such waivers in secret, the New York Times reports.

Trumpâs executive order on ethics has been waived at least 11 times since the administration came into power. Just before taking office, Trump signed an executive order seemingly in line with his âDrain the Swampâ rhetoric, to restrict the role of lobbyists in his administration. While that sounded good at the time, heâs failing to keep that promise. In fact, heâs filling swamp up to an unprecedented level of madness and corruption.

The ethics waivers will now permit White House staffers to work on matters that could affect their former employers or clients or involve issues from which the aides would be normally be excluded because of past lobbying work, Politico reports.

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon are included among those given an ethics pass.

This is not normal:

Chief White House strategist Steve Bannon also received a waiver to the rules as part of a blanket exemption for all White House appointees allowing them to communicate with the press. His reported discussions with former colleagues at the pro-Trump site Breitbart News, which Bannon chaired until last year, had raised red flags among ethics watchdogs.

The swamp isÂ taking over:

The White House waived the rule for Trump energy policy adviser Michael Catanzaro, a former lobbyist for the oil and gas industry. He was given approval to work on âenergy and environmental policy issuesâ including the Clean Power Plan, the Waters of the United States rule and other environmental regulations. Tax policy adviser Shahira Knight, a former Fidelity executive, was approved to deal with tax, retirement and financial services issues even though sheâd previously lobbied on those topics. âThe National Economic Council has been tasked with addressing issues relating to tax, retirement and financial services. The Administration has an interest in you working on matters in those areas due to your expertise and prior experience,â the waiver reads. White House economic aide Andrew Olmem was cleared to work on a variety of finance-related issues despite his lobbying for several big insurance companies and banks.

What is Trump going to do next, sign an executive to pardon for himself and his administration from any past or future crimes? Or sign an executive order to disallow his own impeachment? Weâre not sure why some Trump supporters arenât catching on to the level of corruption in this administration. Seriously, Trump could eat a live puppy then wipe his mouth with its tail and his supporters would cheer him on.

"Most of us tend to be quite selective about who we give our phone number to so you would instantly assume that the President of the United States would guard his personal cell number with a great deal of secrecy too. Well, apparently that isnât the case.

In yet another break from convention, PresidentÂ Donald Trump has been handing out his personal cellphone number to world leaders, telling them to call him directly, raising security concerns in the White House. Even if it is just for conversations with other world leaders, itâs still more than a little hypocritical of President Trump to be using a personal phone when he has spent a great deal of time and energy berating Hillary Clinton for using a private email server while she was Secretary of State, claiming the practice left her vulnerable when sending confidential information and leading to chants of âLock her up!â from Trump supporters while on the presidential campaign.

According to both former and current unnamed US officials, President Trump has urged the leaders of Mexico and Canada to call him on his personal number, however, only Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken him up on the offer. Furthermore,Â according to an unnamed French official, Trump also swapped phone numbers withÂ Emmanuel Macron, President of France, when the two spoke immediately after Macronâs victory earlier in May.

Although it doesnât seem that crazy to think that world leaders might hit each other up on their cells, leader-to-leader calls generally follow a standard protocol. In the case of US Presidents, calls are usually placed on one of several secure phone lines, including those in the White House Situation Room, the Oval Office or the presidential limousine. According to national security experts, Trump using his cellphone for such calls puts him at an extremely high risk of being listened in on, particularly by foreign governments.

âIf you are speaking on an open line, then itâs an open line, meaning those who have the ability to monitor those conversations are doing so,â said Derek Chollet, a former Pentagon adviser and National Security Council official.Â âIf someone is trying to spy on you, then everything youâre saying, you have to presume that others are listening to it.â

A perfect example of this practice was when Edward Snowden leaked that the US was monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkelâs cell in back in 2013, despite Germany being an American ally.

âIf you are Macron or the leader of any country and you get the cellphone number of the president of the United States, itâs reasonable to assume that theyâd hand it right over to their intel service,â said Ashley Deeks, a law professor at the University of Virginia and former assistant legal adviser for political-military affairs in the U.S. State Department.

Giving your personal number out when youâre a New York City real estate mogul is obviouslyly common practice, but Trump should probablyÂ find another way to make his deals now that he is President of the United States.

"It wasnât even a month ago that a company run by the family of Jared Kushner, son-in-law of President Donald Trump, were conducting a presentation in a Beijing ballroom, where Kushnerâs sister wasÂ pitching a real estate project to wealthy Chinese investors that would make it easier to get US visas. Now it has emerged that another relative of Kushner is using his ties to the president in the hope of securing foreign property investors.

The KRE Group, a real estate company run by Jaredâs uncle, Murray Kushner, pitched a Jersey City apartment project to Chinese investors, using images of Donald and Ivanka Trump, as well as Jared, in their presentation in an attempt to seal the deal. âWork hand-in-hand with Trump son-in-law Kushner,â said the pitch, telling attendees that if they invested $500,000, they could qualify for a U.S. resident visa through a program known as EB-5.

The EB-5 visaÂ allows rich foreigners to immigrate to the USA if they are willing to invest large amounts of money into US job-creating projects.

Although neither KRE or Murray Kushner have officially commented on the presentation, one partner in the project, Dave Barry, pinned the blame on the Chinese marketing company they used, Noah Visa. However, Eric Yuan, manager and part owner of Noah Visa, didnât initially agree with Barryâs side of the story, first denying the inclusion of the pictures of the Trumps and Kushner. When it became apparent that screenshots were available from the presentation, Yuan changed his tune and also tried to pass the blame.

âThe media did that to push hot topics; we didnât do it,â he said in a phone conversation. âJared has nothing to do with the project.â

Yuan also stated that Noah Visa no longer promotes the property, located at 235 Grand Street, and claimed that a further presentation scheduled for May 13 was canceled due to lack of interest. When informed of what Dave Barry had said, that the subcontract was ended because the promotion was misleading, Yuan simply hung up the phone.

And to think that many republican voter said they wanted a businessman in the White House.

She gave an interview in which she discussed her electoral college loss, and because Trump canât do anything but attack his imaginary enemies, he took to Twitter to call her âCrooked Hillaryâ once again.

She owned him right after he tried to tell all of Europe that heâs the most important person on the planet.

Hillary is by no means perfect, and she wouldnât have been the perfect president. But she also wouldnât be humiliating us repeatedly the way that Trump does. Trump is making a mockery of the U.S.

"The men investigating the working conditions at the factory that makes, among other products, Ivanka Trumpâs shoe line, have either been arrested or have gone missing.

One of the three men has been arrested while the other two have gone missing. While there is currently no evidence to point the finger at Donald Trump, or even his buddy Vladimir Putin, this does bode badly for BLOTUS in other ways.

First, the facts of the story, from CBS News:

Hua Haifeng was accused of illegal surveillance, according to his wife, Deng Guilian, who said the police called her Tuesday afternoon. Deng said the caller told her she didnât need to know the details, only that she would not be able to see, speak with or receive money from her husband, the familyâs breadwinner. China Labor Watch Executive Director Li Qiang said he lost contact with Hua Haifeng and the other two men, Li Zhao and Su Heng, over the weekend. By Tuesday, after dozens of unanswered calls, he had concluded: âThey must be held either by the factory or the police to be unreachable.â Officials at the Public Security Bureau in Ganzhou would not confirm to CBS News if Hua was detained, but his wife was made aware of the charge Tuesday afternoon.

China Labor Watch is an American human rights organization that tracks workplace abuses in China. They were planning on publishing a report about the factoryâs low wages, excessive overtime and alleged misuse of interns, next month. They have been investigating Chinese factories for 17 years, and they say that itâs never been more of a political hotbed than it is now. This is the first time that their investigators have gone missing or have been detained.

While this does sound like some Putinesque tactics, itâs pretty much indicative of any strong arm dictator. The Chinese ruling Communist Party is feeling especially vulnerable right now and theyâre cracking down on all sorts of threats to the party.

We may never know whether these men were targeted because itâs the factory that makes Ivanka Trumpâs shoes, but we do know that Trump has an affinity for dictators and has even expressed that he had âgreat chemistryâ with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It also raises a lot of questions as to why this particular factory, one that manufactures shoes for the daughter of the American President, was targeted.

We also know that thanks to China, Trump is about to get a lot richer. In February, the Chinese government approved 38 trademarks that Trump had been seeking for almost a year. They had been held up thanks to Once he became president, the process seemed to move rather quickly. Trump has also softened his stance toward China from what it was on the campaign trail. While still a candidate, Trump accused China of manipulating currency.

There are four possibilities here: The Chinese are solely behind it, the Russians are behind it, or Trump is behind it, which is pretty much the same as the Russians being behind it, or it was a collaboration. When you follow the money, there are two clear losers when the violations are reported. While no one is accusing Trump of orchestrating this (is he smart enough, anyway?), he, along with the Chinese government both benefit from this report not being released. For both Trumps, it might just be a happy coincidence.

By Tuesday, after dozens of unanswered calls, he had concluded: âThey must be held either by the factory or the police to be unreachable.â Officials at the Public Security Bureau in Ganzhou would not confirm to CBS News if Hua was detained, but his wife was made aware of the charge Tuesday afternoon.

China Labor Watch is an American human rights organization that tracks workplace abuses in China. They were planning on publishing a report about the factoryâs low wages, excessive overtime and alleged misuse of interns, next month. They have been investigating Chinese factories for 17 years, and they say that itâs never been more of a political hotbed than it is now. This is the first time that their investigators have gone missing or have been detained.

While this does sound like some Putinesque tactics, itâs pretty much indicative of any strong arm dictator. The Chinese ruling Communist Party is feeling especially vulnerable right now and theyâre cracking down on all sorts of threats to the party.

We may never know whether these men were targeted because itâs the factory that makes Ivanka Trumpâs shoes, but we do know that Trump has an affinity for dictators and has even expressed that he had âgreat chemistryâ with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It also raises a lot of questions as to why this particular factory, one that manufactures shoes for the daughter of the American President, was targeted.

We also know that thanks to China, Trump is about to get a lot richer. In February, the Chinese government approved 38 trademarks that Trump had been seeking for almost a year. They had been held up thanks to Once he became president, the process seemed to move rather quickly. Trump has also softened his stance toward China from what it was on the campaign trail. While still a candidate, Trump accused China of manipulating currency.

There are four possibilities here: The Chinese are solely behind it, the Russians are behind it, or Trump is behind it, which is pretty much the same as the Russians being behind it, or it was a collaboration. When you follow the money, there are two clear losers when the violations are reported. While no one is accusing Trump of orchestrating this (is he smart enough, anyway?), he, along with the Chinese government both benefit from this report not being released. For both Trumps, it might just be a happy coincidence.

"The reaction to Trumpâs withdrawing us from the Paris climate agreement was swift and harsh, but one of the harshest reactions came from The Weather Channel, which put the ignoramuses who supported Trump in this disaster in their place."
"The SmithsonianÃ¢ÂÂs Museum of African-American History opened to much fanfare, and also, much hatred from white people who think that such a thing is an affront to white history and therefore, reverse discrimination. Since Trump was elected, hate crimes and incidents have skyrocketed, and now, some racist asshat (or more than one) has decided to take their hatred straight to that museum.

By hanging a noose.

Yes, seriously. Someone hung a noose up in the Museum of African-American History. And not just once, but twice over the last four days. The noose isnÃ¢ÂÂt an innocent symbol. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a stark and painful reminder of the days when lynching was common practice, particularly against black people.

Which is precisely the reason these people hang nooses like that. According to a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, itÃ¢ÂÂs been a long time since we saw hatred like this:

Ã¢ÂÂWe havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen such mainstream support for hate in decades, not since the Civil Rights era 50 years ago. WeÃ¢ÂÂre witnessing a moment when there are tremendous challenges to the country that we built on pluralism and democracy. The civil rights accorded every American are firmly under threat.Ã¢ÂÂ

But people of color, women, the LGBTQ community, and every other marginalized group out there is apparently a direct threat to the straight, white, Christian American, and TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs election has empowered them to act like theyÃ¢ÂÂre just taking their country back from the Ã¢ÂÂscourgeÃ¢ÂÂ of political correctness they so decried during the campaign.

The Smithsonian issued their own statement about this, and they cut whoever it is thatÃ¢ÂÂs responsible for the nooses:

Ã¢ÂÂThe Smithsonian family stands together in condemning this act of hatred and intolerance, especially repugnant in a museum that affirms and celebrates the American values of inclusion and diversity,Ã¢ÂÂ wrote the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution David Skorton in an Institution-wide email. Ã¢ÂÂWe will not be intimated. Cowardly acts like these will not, for one moment, prevent us from the vital work we do.Ã¢ÂÂ

People who do this are trying to drag our country back to a time when they were comfortable because they could step on everybody different from them. We canÃ¢ÂÂt let that continue to happen.

"A new Politico/Morning Consult poll is out, and it shows that TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs approval rating among registered voters is continuing to occupy the dregs of presidential approval ratings. It was conducted during his allegedly successful foreign trip, showing that pretending to be presidential by traveling abroad for conferences and summits didnÃ¢ÂÂt serve to impress voters.

WhatÃ¢ÂÂs worse (better?), though, is the number of people who want him impeached. That number jumped five points over the last week. One week ago, only 38 percent of voters wanted to see him impeached. Morning ConsultÃ¢ÂÂs founder and chief researcher, Kyle Dropp, says:

Ã¢ÂÂIf President Trump was hoping his foreign trip would shift the conversation away from scandals, he may be out of luckâ¦ Over the last week, support for beginning impeachment proceedings among voters rose from 38 percent to 43 percent.Ã¢ÂÂ

While itÃ¢ÂÂs true that most Democrats want to see Trump impeached, and most Republicans donÃ¢ÂÂt want to see him impeached, the fact that this number is rising shows just how growing segments of America view Trump as unfit to serve. In fact, of those who want Trump impeached, a majority see Trump as Ã¢ÂÂunfit to serve and should be removed from office, regardless of whether he committed an impeachable offense or not.Ã¢ÂÂ

Trump went to Europe and made complete fools out of us by calling Germany Ã¢ÂÂbad, very bad,Ã¢ÂÂ and threatening to cut off German cars, despite the fact that most German cars sold here are built here. He literally shoved MontenegroÃ¢ÂÂs prime minister out of his way, he scolded our NATO allies like a bunch of children over something he does not understand, and heÃ¢ÂÂs withdrawing us from the Paris climate agreement.

Couple that with his ongoing obsession with the mediaÃ¢ÂÂincluding continuing to call them Ã¢ÂÂthe enemyÃ¢ÂÂ because they keep calling him out on his stupidity and his liesÃ¢ÂÂand his sheer comfort with being a lying ignoramus on the world stage, and yes. HeÃ¢ÂÂs wholly unfit to serve.

Congress probably wonÃ¢ÂÂt bow to any political pressure on this. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs list of impeachable offenses (like obstructing an official investigation a la Richard Nixon) has to be extensive and inexcusable for the GOP-controlled Congress to draw up articles of impeachment. But when they find themselves backed into that corner, theyÃ¢ÂÂll have to listen to the growing public outcry this poll demonstrates.

"Wednesday morning, Donald Trump brought the world to tears (of laughter) by complaining that too much negative âcovfefeâ has been directed at him.

While the world â including the dictionary â has no f*cking clue what âcovefefeâ is, White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer says that Trump knew what he meant.

Spicer told reporters at an off-camera press briefing that Trump doesnât make mistakes â and he damn sure didnât misspell whatever he was trying to spell when he tweeted about covefefe.

Asked ifÃÂ people should be concerned that the president posted somewhat of an incoherent tweet last night, Spicer said âno.â

The tweet, which stayed up for hours after The Donald sent it out,ÃÂ definitely had meaning to Trump and a few people, Spicer says.

Ã¢ÂÂThe president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant,Ã¢ÂÂ he explained.

And reporters just laughed at him. They attempted to get Spicer to let everyone else in on the meaning, but he quickly moved on to other issues because he was backed into a corner.

Whatever it means, reporters definitely tossed plenty of âcovfefeâ Spicerâs way.

"As if Donald Trump didnât piss off world leaders enough during his awful overseas trip, heâs once again threatening to unravel Americaâs relationship with other countries by reconsideringÃÂ the Paris climate deal. But it turns out, Trump might really be screwed if he does this.

Earlier today, it was announced that Trump would probably be scrapping the plan. After word of this horrible news got out, Tesla CEO Elon Musk decided to act quickly and sent a strong message to Trump on Twitter â and as a member of Trumpâs council of business advisers, this is going to be something the disgraceful POTUS does not want to hear. On Twitter, Musk announced that he will bail on Trumpâs council if the president abandons the Paris climate change deal. MuskÃÂ assured his followers that he would do everything in his power to make Trump rethink this. He wrote:

Ã¢ÂÂDonÃ¢ÂÂt know which way Paris will go, but IÃ¢ÂÂve done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.â

When one of his followers wondered how Musk would react if Trump didnât take his advice, Musk sent a direct threat to Trump:

Ã¢ÂÂWill have no choice but to depart councils in that case.â

While the Tesla CEOÃÂ has gotten a lot of backlash for his role in Trumpâs advisory council in the first place, it is somewhat comforting that heâs using his presence for good in this case. Musk has previously stated that he had joined Trumpâs council because Ã¢ÂÂadvisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration.Ã¢ÂÂ However, with Muskâs latest message to Trump, there clearly seems to be a point in which he is willing to draw the line. Letâs hope Trump listens.

"Some of the biggest corporations in the United States have come together to beg Donald Trump not to abandon the Paris Climate Agreement and they did it on the front page of the New York Times.

âDear President Trump,â they began. âAs some of the largest companies based or operating in the United States, we strongly urge you to keep the United States in the Paris Agreement on climate change.â

âClimate change presents both business risks and business opportunities,â the open letter to Trump explained. âContinued U.S. participation in the agreement benefits U.S. businesses and the U.S. economy in many ways.â These include Ã¢ÂÂstrengthening competitiveness,Ã¢ÂÂ creating jobs, markets, and growth,Ã¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂreducing business risks,Ã¢ÂÂ ÃÂ the letter added, going into each point in detail.

The letter was signed by several of the biggest companies in America, including Adobe, Apple, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Danfoss, Facebook, Gap, Inc., Google, The Hartford, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Ingersoll Rand, Intel Corporation, Johnson Controls, Levi Strauss & Co., Mars Incorporated, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, National Grid, PG&E Corporation, Royal DSM, Salesforce, Schneider Electric, Tiffany & Co., Unilever, and VF Corporation all signed on to the open plea.

The letter was also published in several other major newspapers throughout the country.

âAs businesses concerned with the well-being of our customers, our investors, our communities, and our suppliers, we are strengthening our climate resilience, and we are investing in innovative technologies that can help achieve a clean energy transition. For this transition to succeed, however, governments must lead as well,â the coporations said to Trump. âU.S. business is best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response. The Paris Agreement provides such a framework. As other countries invest in advanced technologies and move forward with the Paris Agreement, we believe the United States can best exercise global leadership and advance U.S. interests by remaining a full partner in this vital global effort,â the letter concluded.

Trump has gone back and forth on whether or not to pull the United States out of the climate deal. Axios announced that it was a done deal and Trump would be withdrawing from the agreement. But the New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump is once again on the fence about the matter and has been influenced by the negative response from big businesses urging him not to abandon the deal.

"Judging by how disastrous Donald Trumpâs first overseas tripÃÂ went, it couldnât have been any more clear that Trump is not physically fit enough to deal with the exhausting demands of being president. He lacked the stamina and energy, as he was reportedly exhausted by the second day and he even had to make use of a golf cart to follow behind other world leaders as they walked.

This was truly humiliating for Trump, especially after spending his entire presidential campaign insulting Democratic rival Hillary Clintonâs stamina â even though she has traveled extensively during her time as Secretary of State and worked tirelessly on her presidential campaign despite having pneumonia. Yet, Fox News is choosing to ignore the obvious and decided to defend Trump, whichÃÂ was absolutely ridiculous.

On Wednesday, Fox News host Jon Scott stated that because Trump has the energy to tweet incoherent thoughts at night, he truly has the âstamina to be president.â Yes, really.

After midnight, Trump had sent out a tweet whining about Ã¢ÂÂthe constant negative press covfefe.Ã¢ÂÂ This obviously went viral for its insanity, and Trump eventually followed it up with another weird tweet in the early hours of the morning:

Trump is obviously losing his mind, but Fox News believes that as long as he can tweet, Trump is good enough to lead the country. Scott commended this unpresidential behavior and argued:

Ã¢ÂÂPeople are enjoying it, youÃ¢ÂÂve got to give him that. It was a big issue during the campaign. He often accused Hillary Clinton of not having the energy, the stamina to be president.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂSo, he was up tweeting at 12:06 a.m., even if it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt exactly a, well, coherent tweet. And then at 5:00 a.m., he deleted it. So, I guess the president is, as he said, a man who needs only a few hours sleep. At any rate, he got 126,000 retweets and 160,000 likes for Ã¢ÂÂcovfefe.âÃ¢ÂÂ

"Former FBI Director James Comey is now one of the most dangerous men in Washington to Donald Trump. There is nothing that could harm Trump like Comey testifying under oath in an open session of Congress â yet that is exactly what Comey plans to do. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly cleared Comey to testify, and boy will that testimony be a doozy.

Of course, we all remember the reports that Comey kept meticulous notes on his conversations with Trump, because the orange wannabe âpresidentâ unsettled him with his inappropriate requests. We also remember how one of those memos was leaked, and it alleged that Trump tried to obstruct justice. Now, new reports suggest that Comey plans to tell the world about every contentious conversation he ever had with Trump â including the parts where what Trump requested of Comey could indeed amount to obstruction of justice regarding the Russia probe â which is, of course, a felony.

Because of the addition of Special Counsel Mueller to the investigation, there will likely be no testimony regarding what is going on inside the investigation himself. However, that matters not in this instance, as it appears that when Comey sits down before the Senate Intelligence Committee, he plans to sing like a canary; in fact, reports say he canât wait to do it. From CNN:

But he appears eager to discuss his tense interactions with Trump before his firing, which have now spurred allegations that the president may have tried to obstruct the investigation. If it happens, Comeyâs public testimony promises to be a dramatic chapter in the months-long controversy, and it will likely bring even more intense scrutiny to an investigation that Trump has repeatedly denounced as a âwitch hunt.â

Indeed, this should be very interesting. We wonât have long to wait, either. While there is no date set in stone just yet, Comeyâs remarks may be up to be scheduled within the next week or two. All he has to do is to make sure that he knows the bounds he must stay within before moving forward.

Pop the popcorn for this one, folks. It will definitely be interesting.

Indeed, this should be very interesting. We wonât have long to wait, either. While there is no date set in stone just yet, Comeyâs remarks may be up to be scheduled within the next week or two. All he has to do is to make sure that he knows the bounds he must stay within before moving forward.

Pop the popcorn for this one, folks. It will definitely be interesting.

"The reaction to Trumpâs withdrawing us from the Paris climate agreement was swift and harsh, but one of the harshest reactions came from The Weather Channel, which put the ignoramuses who supported Trump in this disaster in their place."
"Donald Trump seems determined to make sure that the United States of America is never seen as the leader of the free world again. AsÃÂ his disastrous treatment of the leaders of allied nations at the NATO and G7 summits and his continued attacks on democratic values and his buffoonish behavior on Twitter isnât enough, it is now being reported that Trump plans to continue to put his dangerous and ridiculous notion that climate change is some kind of Chinese hoax into policy. He has taken his worst step yet in that direction, and now plans to pull out of the Paris Accord on Climate Change.

Around 200 countries â including all of the worldâs developed nations â are a part of the deal, of which the United States was instrumental in sealing. Now, we will be on par with third world countries on this issue because one of our political parties seems to think that science isnât real. The decision comes after Senate Republicans wrote Trump a letter urging him to pull out of the deal, citing regulations that would cost American jobs. Then again, we know that the GOP isnât that bright on this issue and many others.

This move comes on the heels of the Trump Administration rolling back most of the climate regulations that the Obama Administration had put in place to help save the environment. The Paris Accord would have the United States commit to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent.

Beyond the disastrous effects on the environment, this is just devastating to Americaâs standing in the world. It shows everyone that we are no longer ready to lead, that we are taking an isolationist approach when it comes to important issues on the world stage, and that we are led by incompetent, science-denying fools who only care about their own craven quest for power.

Say goodbye to your standing in the world, fellow Americans. It was nice while it lasted.

"Donald Trump has been extremely active on Twitter since he returned home from his first international trip as the President of the United States, but at midnight he unleashed what could only be considered an absolute brain-fart of a tweet:

The vague, incomprehensible message looks more like something that would be tweeted after a big night out and itâs still unclear what the President was even tweeting about. Predictive text changes âcovfefeâ to âcoffee,â however, one can only assume that Trump was most likely tweeting about press âcoverageâ. Even then, itâs borderline impossible to guess what he was actually referring to.

Naturally, it didnât take long for #covfefe to become a trending hashtag on Twitter and the domain name covfefe.comÂ has already been registered. As is also the case in situations like this, the internet responded to the whole âcovfefeâ debacle in the only way it knows how â With memes.

Here are the cream of the crop of the tweets that immediately followed President Trumpâs inane Twitter outburst:

"If any of these challenges has ever made sense, this one sure does."
"To Donald Trump, his popularity is everything, which may be why his favorite mode of communication is Twitter. Twitterâs model of having people follow other Twitter accounts, rather than having a mutual âfriendshipâ gives celebrities and notables opportunities to collect thousands or even millions of followers.

Trumpâs personal account has about 31 million followers, which is nothing to sneeze at. Then again Katy Perry has nearly 100 million and Barack Obama nearly 90 million. You have to know that drives Trump absolutely crazy.

Trump has been doing some housecleaning recently by blocking some of his more contentious followers (I know several who were blocked just last week). Still, his Twitter following dramatically increased on Tuesday, and thereâs something very weird about many of those followers. They donât have pictures and theyâve never tweeted.

Trumpâs Twitter acc has suddenly gained 3 mil followers and has been blocking lots of people. New followers look like thisâ¦ pic.twitter.com/uzYkeNsjUC Ã¢ÂÂ John Niven (@NivenJ1) May 30, 2017

John Niven wasnât cherry picking. If you click on Trumpâs recent followers, more of them have no pictures and no tweets than those who are active Twitter users. Theyâre an oddly international (given Trumpâs nationalism) group of followers as well.

These followers are likely bots. They arenât people at all. According to Twitter Audit, only 51 percent of Trumpâs followers are real. Nearly half are fake, and thatâs not just the new ones.

The number of fake accounts has gotten a lot worse since Trump took office.

This isnât the first time someone has pointed out that a good portion of Trumpâs Twitter following is fake, but whatâs interesting is that its fakeness seems to be increasing. In January, journalist Yashar Ali ran an audit on Trumpâs Twitter account and found that 68 percent of his then-20 million followers were real. Now heâs at 30 million followers, but only 51 percent are real, which means of 10 million followers Trump has gained since January, about 8.3 million are fake. Compare that to Barack Obama. 79 percent are real. In April 2016, when Trump was beginning to gain traction as a serious candidate to at least win the Republican presidential nomination, the former reality TV star had a mere 7.58 million followers, only 8 percent of which were fake, according to FiveThirtyEight. Itâs not surprising that as Trumpâs global profile has skyrocketed in the past 13 months, so too have the number of bots attached to his Twitter accountÃ¢ÂÂbut itâs astonishing how much the percentage of his followers that are fake has risen. Source: Newsweek

While fake followers are a pretty serious problem on Facebook, and not one that the user can always control, it is easy to buy Twitter followers and itâs a big problem.

Automated adding to lists or collections: You may not add Twitter users to lists or add Tweets to collections in a bulk or indiscriminate manner. Adding a large number of unrelated users to lists is a violation of the Twitter Rules.

If Trump did pay for the followers (and perhaps even if he didnât), heâs violating Twitterâs rules and his account should be banned.

"After more than two years, theÃÂ Cleveland police officer who fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice hasÃÂ finallyÃÂ been fired. But the reason for his firing has sparked even more outrage.

Timothy Loehmann, who was a rookie when he pullled the trigger on that fateful day in November 2014, was not fired for killing an unarmed child. Instead, he was given his walking papers because he lied on his application.

Cleveland.com reports: âLoehmann was fired not for shooting Tamir, but for lying on his application with the Cleveland police department. He was also in his probationary period as a Cleveland officer giving the department more flexibility in letting him go, Cleveland Public Safety Director MichaelÃÂ McGrath said.â

The disciplinary letter cites a letter in Loehmannâs personnel file from IndependenceÃÂ that says he was emotionally immature and had âan inability to emotionally function.â The letter also cites an emotional breakdown Loehmann had on the gun range in Independence. Cleveland officials said in the letter that Loehmann was supposed to disclose that information. He was also supposed to say in his application that he failed a 2009 written exam when applying to work as an officer in Maple Heights. Loehmann never mentioned the Maple Heights test.

A spokesperson for TamirÃ¢ÂÂs relatives said that Loehmannâs firing was âdeeply disappointingâ andÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂonly added insult to the pain and grief of the Rice family.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂLoehmann has been fired because he should never have been a police officer in the first place Ã¢ÂÂ but he should have been fired for shooting my son in less than one second, not just for lying on his application,Ã¢ÂÂ TamirÃ¢ÂÂs mother, Samaria Rice, said in a statement.

On November 22, 2014, police got a report of a black male with a gun in a local park. The 911 dispatcher didnât bother to mention to police that the caller has said it was most likely a child and the gun was probably a fake. When Loehmann arrived with his partner,ÃÂ Frank Garmback, it took about three seconds for Loehmann to shoot and kill the 12-year-old, who was holding a toy gun.

An Ohio grand jury decided not to incict either of the officers in December of 2015.ÃÂ Garmback was given a 10-day suspension because he pulled his cruiser too close to the child on the day of the shooting, which violated safety protocol. The 911 operator received an eight day suspension in March of this year for her role Riceâs death.ÃÂ The city of Cleveland reached aÃÂ $6 million settlement with the Rice family in April of last year, but still refused to admit to any wrongdoing.

An Ohio grand jury decided not to incict either of the officers in December of 2015.ÃÂ Garmback was given a 10-day suspension because he pulled his cruiser too close to the child on the day of the shooting, which violated safety protocol. The 911 operator received an eight day suspension in March of this year for her role Riceâs death.ÃÂ The city of Cleveland reached aÃÂ $6 million settlement with the Rice family in April of last year, but still refused to admit to any wrongdoing.

"Now that Donald Trump has completed his disastrous first overseas trip, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer must once again answer to the U.S. media as Trump continues to disgrace the country on its own soil.

Following the Memorial Day holiday, it was back to business as usual with Spicer nearly losing his mind at a press briefing earlier today. When reporters asked Spicer about Trumpâs claims about âfake news,â Spicer pretty much imploded as he sparred with reporters.

Spicer tried to defend his mentally incompetent boss by pointing out a tweet in which a BBC reported had made a mistake, claiming that Trump had not been wearing a translation earpiece when he met with foreign leaders. This mistake was quickly and publicly corrected by the reporter as soon as it was realized, but Spicer pathetically latched onto that one incident as proof of âfake news.â Spicer whined:

Ã¢ÂÂOn Friday, the president was having a great discussion at the G7 and someone from the BBC, and ultimately an incoming reporter for the New York Times retweeted that the president was being rude by disrespecting the Italian prime minister. When in fact, you all in all of the meetings watched the president with that oneÃÂ earpiece thatÃ¢ÂÂs been used by all the other presidentsÃ¢ÂÂ¦ ThatÃ¢ÂÂs just fake!Ã¢ÂÂ

Spicerâs example was beyond ridiculous, and reporters not only reminded him that the inaccurate tweet had been corrected, but that it hadnât gone any further to major newspapers. But Spicer was beyond reasoning with. He fired back, looking as if a meltdown was just moments away:

Ã¢ÂÂI was asked to give an example, and I did it.â

And when another reporter said the BBC reporterâs tweet didnât affect how Trumpâs overseas trip was covered, Spicerâs reply was nothing but disrespectful and dismissive. He replied sarcastically:

Ã¢ÂÂWell, thank you, I appreciate it, you get to decide what is big and what is not. A lot of things have been pushed out based on unnamed unaccountable sources that is very troubling.Ã¢ÂÂ

Clearly, Spicer forgot that his own boss is the king of using anonymous sources and perpetuating fake news. You can watch Spicer fight with reporters below:

Republicans are finding it more and more difficult to defend their actions. Trump, and the party he leads, have begun systematically dismantling many of the programs, reforms, and regulations that have protected Americans and the environment from depredation. Many of the assaults on the country have been done in the name of tax cuts which will disproportionately help the richest people, leaving the poor and middle class with even less than they have now. Itâs hard to justify that.

Adding to the GOPâs troubles, their leader is a mentally unstable child whose incompetence is matched only with the apparent corruption running through his administration. Every day more information leaks out about wrongdoing in the Trump White House. And every day, guys like Darrell Issa are forced to defend Trump and further destroy their reputations.

So we have a congressman standing on his rooftop refusing to come down, something that would be beyond parody if it hadnât already been explored in comedy.

Republican voters need to take a good hard look at who is representing them in Congress. There arenât a lot of things to be proud of. And quite a bit to be completely ashamed of.

There are many ways you can ruin the date. Even when you drive an expensive car. These are just some of the things that will really impact your first date. If you want to ruin necessarily, make them, but if you want a positive outcome, try to avoid them:

10 – Demonstration of anger, anxiety and swearing while driving

It’s very hard to find a girl who likes that sort of thing!

9 -Your car is too dirty and messy.

8 – Your car is too clean

A car that’s too clean might also be an indication that you’re driving a douche mobile..

7 – Refusing to pay for parking

Of course, you do not need to throw money or spend it on nonsense. You might think that the parking is too expensive. But if you circling the neighborhood half the night to find free parking is not good.

6 – Changing a tire with a phone

Got a flat?Show her you can handle a rubber malfunction yourself and keep the date moving along without help from a man in a fluorescent vest.

5 – Sitting like a douche

There are few guys in the universe who can rock that stance, and you aren’t one of them.

4. Thumpin’ the bass

Two hundred decibels of hip-hop leaving her fillings loose and ears bleeding? No, not reallyThe point is, whatever you play, keep it at a level good for hearing — and hearing her.

3 – Drive too fast

Yes, there are girls who like driving fast, but mainly on training grounds provided for it. Most of the girls on the street like a custom speed, not slow, but not too fast.

2 -Pathetic parallel parking

Yes, there are many people who are not good at parking.Of all the ways to ruin a date with your car, piss-poor parallel parking is too often overlooked. Don’t make that mistake, because to her, parking is a metaphoric judgment of your sexual ability.

1 – You drink too much

Nursing one or two over dinner is one thing, but you’ve gone way too far when you endanger her with driving drunk or even buzzed.

"Furious 7 has been outed for featuring the most mistakes of any movie in 2015, with a red-faced 41.

Website Movie Mistakes makes sure no errors go unnoticed, with over 8,000 films listed in its database of shame.

The seventh movie in the Fast & Furious franchise blundered in a range of ways from factual errors to continuity hiccups, with crew and filming equipment spotted in several scenes.

Although many of the mistakes are permissible, some are too hilarious not to make fun of, like when Elena tells Dom that Hobbs “shattered his collarbone, fractured his leg in two places.” When the camera pans over to him, he has a cast on his forearm and everything else looks completely fine.

Right behind him comes Jurassic World with 33 errors, and the Oscar nominee movie The Martian with a 21 mistake.

Spectre, film of the series James Bond in 2015 made 16 errors, and one of the best films of the year Mad Max: Fury Road has them 15th

Arnold Schwarzenegger’s role as the Terminator in the movie Genisys recorded 11 errors, while Marvel and Ant-Man have the 10th

The list of 10 films concludes Fifty Shades of Grey with eight, Minions with 7, Avengers: Age of Ultron, also with seven faults.

"With these 3 ingredients to perfect lashes just 7 days!

If you are not blessed with long lashes, you should try this.

A new way to make eyelashes grow and this way definitely works !

You only need three ingredients and a little patience …

The recipe for faster growth of eyelashes

In a small bowl, mix in equal proportions of these ingredients:

– 20 ml of coconut oil

– 20 ml of vitamin E oil

– 20 ml of castor oil

You can use for this purpose small boxes of facial cream.

Stir these three oils. Every oil should be a one-third of the total amount.

Shake the mixture and every evening apply a small amount of it on the upper lash line (swab or a sponge brush).

It is important that before you apply the oil, be sure to clean up your eyes and face!

Do not be discouraged if you do not see results immediately. After 1 week you will have visibly longer lashes! To complete the effect, be patient and repeat the procedure a few weeks.

This will help you get the look you’ve always wanted.

I was so impressed with the results after a week that I had to share it!

"For those who do not have a garage, this is probably the usual question in winter – what is the easiest way to defrost the car?

Although there are many chemicals that would facilitate the removal of the ice many of them are not too good for you or for the car.

If the ice is thicker you will need more time to clean it and usually chemicals wouldn’t work.

The key lies in prevention, but you do not have to pull some expensive solutions, because cheaper and more accessible ways are just around the corner.

One of the simplest ways is to cover the windshield with a cardboard. Get a cardboard box that is wide enough to cover the entire windshield. In the evening, put the card through the windscreen and secure it with the wiper. In the morning the job should be much easier. Also,you can use any large paper bag.

You probably already have some protection from the sun, reflective foil or something similar? Now it’s maybe time to put it on the outside of the windshield and secure it with the wipes.

Similarly, a piece of fabric would do, it is essential that its large enough to cover the whole windshield.

You can also prepare a mixture of ¾ white vinegar and ¼ water, and spray the windshield in the evening.

If you haven’t made good preparations and the snow and ice have been pasted on the windshield, vinegar is one of the cheap supplies for home use that can serve this purpose, if you don’t mind the smell.

To remove ice, you can use a mixture of ½ vinegar and ½ water. Also, you can make in a bottle with a spray mixture of ½ water and ½ of ethyl alcohol.Spray the mixture, leave thirty seconds to take effect, and then begin scraping ice.

If the ice caught the wipes you can use alcohol to quickly melt the ice off them.

Do not use hot water to clean the ice, because the combination of hot water and ice can affect the windshield and break it.

If you have heated windshield it is important not to turn it up immediately to the max because it can lead to microcracks in the structure of the glass. Just turn the car on and let the temperature rise slowly.

"UNHEARD AND OVERLOOKED BY THE DEMOCRATS (AND MANY REPUBLICANS), BLUE COLLAR MEN ARE TIRED OF BEING IGNORED

There’s a massive demographic that is quietly FED UP with Hillary’s nonsense. They’re tired, angry, and love what Trump has to say.

POWELLTON, W.Va. — Deep in the belly of an Appalachian mountain, a powerful machine bored into the earth, its whirring teeth clawing out a stream of glistening coal. Men followed inside the Maple Eagle No. 1 mine, their torches cutting through the dank air. One guided the machine with a PlayStation-like controller; others bolted supports in the freshly cut roof.

They were angry. The coal industry that made West Virginia prosperous has been devastated. Every day, it seemed, another mine laid off workers or closed entirely. Friends were forfeiting their cars, homes, and futures.

For these men, this season’s presidential campaign boils down to a single choice. “I’m for Trump,” said Dwayne Riston, 27, his face smeared in dust. “Way I see it, if he wins, we might at least stand a chance of surviving.”

Few places in America offer such a simple electoral calculus as the rolling, tree-studded hills of West Virginia.

Even as Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, lags badly in crucial swing states and loses his grip on white male voters over all, he remains on solid ground here with his promise to “bring back coal.” The fact that his Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton, said in March, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” has helped, too.

But this is not just about economics. West Virginia’s coal country is part of the broader white, working-class vote that has coalesced around a single candidate, Mr. Trump, like never before. His support here stems from a profound, decades-in-the-making sense of political and cultural alienation that has left people feeling distant from their leaders, and even from fellow Americans.

“I kind of feel that people are looking down on us,” said Neil Hanshew, a miner, voicing a common sentiment. “They’re looking at us like we’re a bunch of dumb hillbillies who can’t do anything else.”

"Filmmaker claims Republican nominee is self-sabotaging campaign he launched as a negotiating tactic.

Michael Moore has claimed that Donald Trump never wanted to be president but began his campaign as a way to gain leverage while negotiating a new deal with NBC. While the director did not name his sources, he wrote in The Huffington Post, “there are certain people reading this right now, they know who they are, and they know that every word in the following paragraphs actually happened.”

“In the end, young people, women, blacks, and Hispanics are going to rule this country. That’s why I’m an optimist,” filmmaker says

According to Moore, Trump was unhappy with the money he was making as host and star of The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice, and believed a presidential bid — and all the attention it would garner — would prove to NBC that he was worth millions more than what he was being paid. However, Trump’s plan immediately backfired when he launched his campaign with an infamous press conference where he called Mexicans “rapists” and “drug dealers,” and pledged to build a border wall. NBC immediately fired him.

Trump nevertheless stuck with his plan as a way to increase his value in the eyes of other television networks. Both the candidate and those in his circle believed he wouldn’t win many primaries, let alone the nomination or the presidency.

But as Trump’s polls surged, his campaign became a media sensation and he actually started winning, Trump supposedly put aside his search for a better TV deal and relished the near-universal attention. Moore, however, pointed to Trump’s uncharacteristically restrained speech after winning the New Jersey primary and clinching the Republican nomination as the moment the ruse finally caught up with him.

“No energy, no happiness, just the realization that now he was going to have to go through with this stunt that he started. It was no longer going to be performance art. He was going to have to go to work.”

While Moore wrote that Trump’s increasingly detrimental gaffes over the past several weeks — fighting with Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, suggesting second amendment supporters stop Hillary Clinton — could be considered karma, the director theorized it might actually be self-sabotage.

“Many now are sensing the end game here because they know Trump seriously doesn’t want to do the actual job — and, most importantly, he cannot and WILL NOT suffer through being officially and legally declared a loser — LOSER! — on the night of November 8th.”

Moore closed his piece with a personal message to Trump urging him to bow out soon so that the Republicans could nominate Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney, lose the presidency and perhaps with it the House of Representatives, the Senate and Supreme Court. “Don’t be too hard on yourself,” Moore added. “You’re only the logical conclusion to a party that has lived off the currency of racism and bigotry and fellating the one percent for decades, and now their Trump has come home to roost.”

“Many now are sensing the end game here because they know Trump seriously doesn’t want to do the actual job — and, most importantly, he cannot and WILL NOT suffer through being officially and legally declared a loser — LOSER! — on the night of November 8th.”

Moore closed his piece with a personal message to Trump urging him to bow out soon so that the Republicans could nominate Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney, lose the presidency and perhaps with it the House of Representatives, the Senate and Supreme Court. “Don’t be too hard on yourself,” Moore added. “You’re only the logical conclusion to a party that has lived off the currency of racism and bigotry and fellating the one percent for decades, and now their Trump has come home to roost.”

"Filmmaker claims Republican nominee is self-sabotaging campaign he launched as a negotiating tactic.

Michael Moore has claimed that Donald Trump never wanted to be president but began his campaign as a way to gain leverage while negotiating a new deal with NBC. While the director did not name his sources, he wrote in The Huffington Post, “there are certain people reading this right now, they know who they are, and they know that every word in the following paragraphs actually happened.”

“In the end, young people, women, blacks, and Hispanics are going to rule this country. That’s why I’m an optimist,” filmmaker says

According to Moore, Trump was unhappy with the money he was making as host and star of The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice, and believed a presidential bid — and all the attention it would garner — would prove to NBC that he was worth millions more than what he was being paid. However, Trump’s plan immediately backfired when he launched his campaign with an infamous press conference where he called Mexicans “rapists” and “drug dealers,” and pledged to build a border wall. NBC immediately fired him.

Trump nevertheless stuck with his plan as a way to increase his value in the eyes of other television networks. Both the candidate and those in his circle believed he wouldn’t win many primaries, let alone the nomination or the presidency.

But as Trump’s polls surged, his campaign became a media sensation and he actually started winning, Trump supposedly put aside his search for a better TV deal and relished the near-universal attention. Moore, however, pointed to Trump’s uncharacteristically restrained speech after winning the New Jersey primary and clinching the Republican nomination as the moment the ruse finally caught up with him.

“No energy, no happiness, just the realization that now he was going to have to go through with this stunt that he started. It was no longer going to be performance art. He was going to have to go to work.”

"In a speech in Dimondale, Michigan, on Friday directed at winning over black voters, Donald Trump detoured from his prepared remarks in order to tell black voters that their lives are terrible and can only be improved by voting for Donald Trump.

“What do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump?” he said. “What do you have to lose? You’re living in poverty; your schools are no good; you have no jobs; 58 percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?”

Never mind that Trump—who recently polled at 1 percent among black voters in a nationwide survey—was treating black people as a monolithic group of poor, unemployed people. His ad-libbed “what the hell do you have to lose” line sounded very much like Trump thinks he knows what’s better for black voters than they know for themselves.

Compare Trump’s actual statements with his prepared remarks and you can see how badly he went off the rails:

Look at how much African-American communities have suffered under Democratic Control. To those hurting, I say: what do you have to lose by trying something new?

There were other moments where Trump veered wildly off-script in a way that seemed absurd. Specifically, Trump said that he would not just win this election, but win re-election in 2020 with 95 percent of black voters supporting him—again, earlier this month Trump’s polling among black voters was somewhere between 1 and 4 percent.

“At the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get 95 percent of the African-American vote,” he said. “I promise you, because I will produce for the inner cities and I will produce for the African-Americans.” Source :http://www.slate.com/

"A super-PAC backing Hillary Clinton has accepted $200,000 in donations from a company holding multiple contracts with the federal government — despite a ban on such contributions.

Boston-based Suffolk Construction made two contributions of $100,000 to Priorities USA, which is backing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.

At the time it made the contributions, Suffolk held multiple contracts worth $976,560 with the Department of Defense for maintenance and construction projects at a Naval base in Newport, R.I., and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., according to the government website USASpending.gov.

Suffolk — which, by Forbes’s estimate, brings in some $2 billion in revenue annually — also donated $10,000 in 2015 to Right to Rise, a super-PAC that supported Republican Jeb Bush’s now-defunct presidential bid.

The donations from Suffolk highlight how a 70-year-old campaign finance law meant to prevent pay-to-play deals between public officials and companies making money from the government is often ignored by those making the donations and those on the receiving end.

The two contributions, one made in July and one in December, came during Clinton’s presidential primary battle with Bernie Sanders, who rose to prominence partly because he railed against super-PACs and the wealthy donors who fund them. The two Suffolk donations to Priorities USA were initially highlighted in a story by the Center for Public Integrity.

A review of campaign finance records by The Hill shows that the practice of skirting or openly flouting the contractor ban has become widespread in both congressional and presidential politics.

There are multiple reasons why the law is ignored.

Some lawyers believe the prohibition on a contractor giving to a super-PAC is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has never issued a ruling on the specific matter.

Perhaps more importantly, donors face little chance of being penalized by a Federal Election Commission (FEC) that is so divided between its Republican and Democratic members it has proved incapable of deciding even the most basic questions, such as whether to investigate complaints.

Priorities USA stipulates on its website that donors can’t be federal contractors. Yet a spokesman for the super-PAC declined to comment in response to a question about whether the donations from Suffolk would be returned.

Clinton’s campaign also declined to comment.

“The increasing trend of contractors violating the law comes as no surprise,” said Craig Holman of Public Citizen, an advocacy group that was involved in a high-profile case regarding the ban.

In addition to the donations to Priorities USA, The Hill found 14 federal contractors that had contributed a total of $173,250 to Right to Rise. Two had also given to Conservative Solutions PAC, a group that supported Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) bid for president.

One contractor, a Florida utility named Gulf Power Co., gave $44,000 to Right to Rise in March 2015. At the time, the company held more than $1 million in contracts with the Department of Defense.

The Hill asked Gulf Power whether the company was aware it was in violation of the ban and if it believed there was a conflict of interest in politicians benefiting from donations from federal contractors.

Jeff Rogers, a spokesman for the company, responded, “We believe Gulf Power’s right to make the contribution in question is constitutionally protected.”

Suffolk Construction, which since 2008 has received $169.7 million in federal contracts, according to USASpending.­gov, declined multiple requests for comment.

John Fish, the company’s CEO, has been a prolific donor to both parties over the years, though FEC records show he favors Democrats by a wide margin. He’s contributed thousands to President Obama’s White House bids and gave $500 to his 2004 Senate campaign.

Fish’s office did not return a request for comment.

The company itself has mainly funneled money to Republicans. In 2012 it gave $510,000 to Restore Our Future, a super-PAC supporting GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, and $50,000 to another group backing then-Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.).

Campaign finance lawyers say federal contractors that donate to super-PACs are taking a calculated risk that the politically deadlocked FEC will never take action against them.

History suggests they’re correct.

In 2012, a Los Angeles Times investigation found that a number of companies with federal contracts, including Suffolk Construction, had, at that point, contributed $890,000 to Restore Our Future.

None of the federal contractors were ever punished for their super-PAC donations.

A top official who worked for Romney’s now-defunct super-PAC declined to comment. Officials who worked for the Bush and Rubio super-PACs also declined to comment.

There are also loopholes in the federal contractor ban. The biggest allows employees and corporate officers of companies with federal contracts to contribute to any candidate or committee of their choosing. They can also establish super-PACs in the name of their own company.

Another way around the federal contractor ban is colloquially known as the “Chevron loophole” and gives contractors with multiple subsidiaries the freedom to make political contributions through business entities not named on the government contracts.

In 2013 Public Citizen filed a complaint with the FEC against the oil giant Chevron, which had held hundreds of federal contracts worth $1.5 billion. The complaint centered on a $2.5 million contribution it made to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super-PAC linked to then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) that was committed to electing House GOP candidates.

In a 5-1 decision, the FEC ruled that the company’s contribution was legal because the federal contract went to a subsidiary, Chevron USA, which is distinct from Chevron, the entity that made the contribution.

The two Chevron entities share a headquarters in San Ramon, Calif.

A spokeswoman for Chevron declined to comment for this article.

Holman said the extraordinary development is that following the ruling, federal contractors aren’t even bothering to take advantage of the loophole, knowing they are unlikely to face any repercussions.

“Contractors now may circumvent the law either by creating an artificial division within the company for the purpose of making contributions, or even not bother with such machinations and make direct contributions and can still feel assured they will not be prosecuted by a deadlocked FEC for violating the law,” he told The Hill.

The federal contractor ban survived a legal challenge in 2015 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the law in a suit against the FEC.

Writing for the 11-judge panel, Chief Judge Merrick Garland — now President Obama’s nominee to the Supreme Court — wrote that the ban is a necessary defense against corruption.

“The statute was itself the outgrowth of a decades-long congressional effort to prevent corruption and ensure the merit-based administration of the national government,” Garland wrote. “And it was followed by subsequent scandals that led to further legislative refinements, again motivated by concerns over corruption and merit protection.”

Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a campaign finance watchdog that has been working on fighting the influence of money in politics for four decades, said that the current open flouting of the federal contractor ban is emblematic of a much larger problem.

“Every political operative and campaign know that the FEC will not enforce the campaign finance laws,” Wertheimer said.

“There’s an old line: ‘If you don’t have enforcement of laws, you do not have the laws.’

“And that’s what we’re dealing with.”

Holman said the extraordinary development is that following the ruling, federal contractors aren’t even bothering to take advantage of the loophole, knowing they are unlikely to face any repercussions.

“Contractors now may circumvent the law either by creating an artificial division within the company for the purpose of making contributions, or even not bother with such machinations and make direct contributions and can still feel assured they will not be prosecuted by a deadlocked FEC for violating the law,” he told The Hill.

The federal contractor ban survived a legal challenge in 2015 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the law in a suit against the FEC.

Writing for the 11-judge panel, Chief Judge Merrick Garland — now President Obama’s nominee to the Supreme Court — wrote that the ban is a necessary defense against corruption.

“The statute was itself the outgrowth of a decades-long congressional effort to prevent corruption and ensure the merit-based administration of the national government,” Garland wrote. “And it was followed by subsequent scandals that led to further legislative refinements, again motivated by concerns over corruption and merit protection.”

Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a campaign finance watchdog that has been working on fighting the influence of money in politics for four decades, said that the current open flouting of the federal contractor ban is emblematic of a much larger problem.

“Every political operative and campaign know that the FEC will not enforce the campaign finance laws,” Wertheimer said.

“There’s an old line: ‘If you don’t have enforcement of laws, you do not have the laws.’

“And that’s what we’re dealing with.”

"A super-PAC backing Hillary Clinton has accepted $200,000 in donations from a company holding multiple contracts with the federal government — despite a ban on such contributions.

Boston-based Suffolk Construction made two contributions of $100,000 to Priorities USA, which is backing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.

At the time it made the contributions, Suffolk held multiple contracts worth $976,560 with the Department of Defense for maintenance and construction projects at a Naval base in Newport, R.I., and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., according to the government website USASpending.gov.

Suffolk — which, by Forbes’s estimate, brings in some $2 billion in revenue annually — also donated $10,000 in 2015 to Right to Rise, a super-PAC that supported Republican Jeb Bush’s now-defunct presidential bid.

The donations from Suffolk highlight how a 70-year-old campaign finance law meant to prevent pay-to-play deals between public officials and companies making money from the government is often ignored by those making the donations and those on the receiving end.

The two contributions, one made in July and one in December, came during Clinton’s presidential primary battle with Bernie Sanders, who rose to prominence partly because he railed against super-PACs and the wealthy donors who fund them. The two Suffolk donations to Priorities USA were initially highlighted in a story by the Center for Public Integrity.

A review of campaign finance records by The Hill shows that the practice of skirting or openly flouting the contractor ban has become widespread in both congressional and presidential politics.

There are multiple reasons why the law is ignored.

Some lawyers believe the prohibition on a contractor giving to a super-PAC is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has never issued a ruling on the specific matter.

Perhaps more importantly, donors face little chance of being penalized by a Federal Election Commission (FEC) that is so divided between its Republican and Democratic members it has proved incapable of deciding even the most basic questions, such as whether to investigate complaints.

Priorities USA stipulates on its website that donors can’t be federal contractors. Yet a spokesman for the super-PAC declined to comment in response to a question about whether the donations from Suffolk would be returned.

Clinton’s campaign also declined to comment.

“The increasing trend of contractors violating the law comes as no surprise,” said Craig Holman of Public Citizen, an advocacy group that was involved in a high-profile case regarding the ban.

In addition to the donations to Priorities USA, The Hill found 14 federal contractors that had contributed a total of $173,250 to Right to Rise. Two had also given to Conservative Solutions PAC, a group that supported Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) bid for president.

One contractor, a Florida utility named Gulf Power Co., gave $44,000 to Right to Rise in March 2015. At the time, the company held more than $1 million in contracts with the Department of Defense.

The Hill asked Gulf Power whether the company was aware it was in violation of the ban and if it believed there was a conflict of interest in politicians benefiting from donations from federal contractors.

Jeff Rogers, a spokesman for the company, responded, “We believe Gulf Power’s right to make the contribution in question is constitutionally protected.”

Suffolk Construction, which since 2008 has received $169.7 million in federal contracts, according to USASpending.­gov, declined multiple requests for comment.

John Fish, the company’s CEO, has been a prolific donor to both parties over the years, though FEC records show he favors Democrats by a wide margin. He’s contributed thousands to President Obama’s White House bids and gave $500 to his 2004 Senate campaign.

Fish’s office did not return a request for comment.

The company itself has mainly funneled money to Republicans. In 2012 it gave $510,000 to Restore Our Future, a super-PAC supporting GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, and $50,000 to another group backing then-Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.).

Campaign finance lawyers say federal contractors that donate to super-PACs are taking a calculated risk that the politically deadlocked FEC will never take action against them.

History suggests they’re correct.

In 2012, a Los Angeles Times investigation found that a number of companies with federal contracts, including Suffolk Construction, had, at that point, contributed $890,000 to Restore Our Future.

None of the federal contractors were ever punished for their super-PAC donations.

A top official who worked for Romney’s now-defunct super-PAC declined to comment. Officials who worked for the Bush and Rubio super-PACs also declined to comment.

There are also loopholes in the federal contractor ban. The biggest allows employees and corporate officers of companies with federal contracts to contribute to any candidate or committee of their choosing. They can also establish super-PACs in the name of their own company.

Another way around the federal contractor ban is colloquially known as the “Chevron loophole” and gives contractors with multiple subsidiaries the freedom to make political contributions through business entities not named on the government contracts.

In 2013 Public Citizen filed a complaint with the FEC against the oil giant Chevron, which had held hundreds of federal contracts worth $1.5 billion. The complaint centered on a $2.5 million contribution it made to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super-PAC linked to then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) that was committed to electing House GOP candidates.

In a 5-1 decision, the FEC ruled that the company’s contribution was legal because the federal contract went to a subsidiary, Chevron USA, which is distinct from Chevron, the entity that made the contribution.

The two Chevron entities share a headquarters in San Ramon, Calif.

A spokeswoman for Chevron declined to comment for this article.

Holman said the extraordinary development is that following the ruling, federal contractors aren’t even bothering to take advantage of the loophole, knowing they are unlikely to face any repercussions.

"Beside that it accelerates as a supercar, it seems that the Tesla Model S can as quickly turn into ashes.

At one of the fast charging stations in Norway, Tesla Model S set on fire and totally burned. During this incident , no one was hurt.

The state news agency NRK said there were no injuries in this catastrophic event, as there was no one present in the vicinity, and the owner left the vehicle.

For now, there is no known cause for the fire, and firefighters had to use a special chemical foam to extinguish lithium-ion batteries.

This is not the first Model S to end in flames, and besides incidents while charging, these vehicles were set on fire several times during a collision.Although a bit discouraging for the owners, we all still turn our heads when one drives by…

"Many drivers, faced with high fuel prices in the past, were driving with too low RPM’s with a desire to save some fuel, not knowing that they could do great damage to the engine.

Driving with too low RPM reduces lubrication and cooling, increases vibrations and reduces engine life. This is especially harmful when we demand more of the engine, like while driving uphill, during acceleration, or when the car is overloaded.In that case is much better to drive at higher RPM.

For the gasoline cars, the most favorable range is between 2,000 and 4,000 RPM, and the diesel between 1,700 and 3,000 / min. Then we have minimal consumption and optimal cooling and lubrication.

Also, should avoid sharp pressing the accelerator at low speed. In that situation, there’s an imbalance in the engine which leads to dry friction and increased wear.

So, low RPM is recommendable only while cruising on flat terrain or downhill.

"The thyroid is a ductless gland located in the neck that is responsible for releasing hormones that control metabolism. It also regulates other body functions like breathing, heart rate, central and peripheral nervous systems, body weight, muscle strength, menstrual cycles, body temperature, cholesterol levels, and so much more. (Endocrine Web)

The thyroid uses iodine it sucks from the blood to make many hormones, but the two major ones are triiodothyronine and thyroxine. Too much of these hormones cause anxiety, irritability, nervousness, sweating, shaking, hair loss, and missed or light menstrual periods. Too little causes, insomnia, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, dry hair and skin, depression, sensitivity to cold, heavy periods, and joint or muscle pain.

Thyroid cancer is the most rapidly increasing cancer in the US. (American Cancer Society) Some health professionals blame the increase in thyroid cancer to the extra chemicals that are in processed foods. The thyroid just sucks up these chemicals with the iodine and all the toxicity causes cancer.

Just like with breast cancer, there is a self-check for thyroid cancer.

"The perfect female body.

Does it exist? Scientifically, yes.

If that’s not surprising, wait till you see what said perfect body actually looks like. It’s nothing like what the fashion industry might have you thinking, that’s for sure.

Researchers at the University of Texas say the perfect female body measures 1.68 meters in height. The bust/weight/hip measurements are 99-63-91.

In case you don’t have the ability to automatically picture the female body types based on measurements, that looks like this.

That woman is Kelly Brook. She’s a 34-year-old model and actress from England.

Most people would refer to her as “plump.” That’s what talent scouts said when Brook first tried to break into the modeling world.

But, according to scientists, Brook’s all-natural body is perfect in terms of attractiveness.

And what makes attractiveness so important, you ask? Well, it signifies the most important trait a human can have, scientifically speaking – fertility.

After all, the primary function of individuals in any species is to support future generations – a full figure communicates one’s efficiency at doing just that through not only pregnancy but feeding as well.

Men are attracted to women whose facial and body characteristics – like Kelly Brook’s – are associated with youth and good health.

This attraction transcends culture. Studies have shown that even when two men come from entirely different backgrounds, they will likely be attracted to the same woman with more youthful, healthy characteristics.

So why all the skinny models, then?

Because they’re trying to sell clothes, not convey fertility.

That’s according to Jennifer Lee, who formerly worked for top designer Karl Lagerfield, the head of Chanel.

Fashion models are hired based on their ability to highlight the lines and structure of the clothing they wear. That’s why we see very few women in the industry who look like Kelly Brook.

But while thin supermodels might make a flowing dress look good on the runway, scientifically – as the study involving Kelly Brook has shown – most men would prefer a woman several times larger.

Being too skinny is an indicator of unhealthiness and can lead to a variety of problems. Being too large isn’t good either; finding a healthy balance is key.

What do you think about the idea of there being an “ideal body size?” Let us know in the comments!

Check out the video below to learn about female body types and history.

"It’s been a long battle towards self-acceptance for Alicia Keys. The 35-year-old singer penned an empowering letter about her new choice to not wear makeup.

In the letter, Keys explains how she battled with the scrutiny she faced when she was thrust into the forefront of the music industry. “I started, more than ever, to become a chameleon. Never fully being who I was, but constantly changing so all the “they’s” would accept me,” she writes.

Before her new album, though, Keys started to list “all the things that I was sick of” which included the idea of beauty standards.

“One of the many things I was tired of was the constant judgment of women. The constant stereotyping through every medium that makes us feel like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you’re plus-size,” she writes. “Or the constant message that being sexy means being naked. All of it is so frustrating and so freakin’ impossible. I realized that during this process, I wrote a lot of songs about masks filled with metaphors about hiding. I needed these songs because I was really feeling those insecurities.”

Now that Keys is back to the forefront in the promotion of new music on the way, Keys was feeling it all over again. But with the help of meditation and a photographer by the name of Paola who captured her without makeup, she was able to recognize her new purpose. The photo also became the “In Common” single art.

“I felt powerful because my initial intentions realized themselves. My desire to listen to myself, to tear down the walls I built over all those years, to be full of purpose, and to be myself!” she writes. “The universe was listening to those things I’d promised myself, or maybe I was just finally listening to the universe, but however it goes, that’s how this whole #nomakeup thing began. Once the photo I took with Paola came out as the artwork for my new song ‘In Common,’ it was that truth that resonated with others who posted #nomakeup selfies in response to this real and raw me.”

"There has been an awakening… in the cosmetics aisle at your local big box store. CoverGirl has officially revealed their Star Wars: The Force Awakens inspired makeup collection, and it’s all about choosing between the light and dark sides of the Force. Word of CoverGirl’s Star Wars collection leaked in June, along with pictures of packaging, and I was already drooling then. Now that we have a closer look at the products and shades, I’m just going to go ahead and set credits aside.

The line includes six new lipstick colors, three shades of nail polish, and ten tubes of mascara featuring quotes from the Star Wars films–including the first six films and The Force Awakens. CoverGirl Global Creative Design Director Pat McGrath has come up with six different and dramatic looks using products from the collection, and those are being unveiled at CoverGirl’s Star Wars Tumblr.

On to the product! The Colorlicious lipstick comes in new shades exclusive to the Star Wars collection. You can choose from Dark Purple, Gold, Red, Lilac, Silver, and Nude. And yes, I want them all.

I’ll have to be more selective with the mascara. The tubes of light side quotes are waterproof, the dark side quotes are not. Other than that, there’s not much difference between the items except for the quote on the container.

Flip through the gallery below to get a closer look at the products and to see the nail polish–it comes in Light, Nemesis, or Red Revenge. You’ll be able to purchase CoverGirl’s Star Wars collection online beginning September 4th (Force Friday) and in stores beginning in mid-September. The collection is limited so be sure to grab products as early as you can if you want them.

Do you find yourself needing all the makeup just because it has Star Wars on the packaging? Because I maybe have that problem. Head to the comments and let me know what you plan on buying from this line.

"Furious 7 has been outed for featuring the most mistakes of any movie in 2015, with a red-faced 41.

Website Movie Mistakes makes sure no errors go unnoticed, with over 8,000 films listed in its database of shame.

The seventh movie in the Fast & Furious franchise blundered in a range of ways from factual errors to continuity hiccups, with crew and filming equipment spotted in several scenes.

Although many of the mistakes are permissible, some are too hilarious not to make fun of, like when Elena tells Dom that Hobbs “shattered his collarbone, fractured his leg in two places.” When the camera pans over to him, he has a cast on his forearm and everything else looks completely fine.

Right behind him comes Jurassic World with 33 errors, and the Oscar nominee movie The Martian with a 21 mistake.

Spectre, film of the series James Bond in 2015 made 16 errors, and one of the best films of the year Mad Max: Fury Road has them 15th

Arnold Schwarzenegger’s role as the Terminator in the movie Genisys recorded 11 errors, while Marvel and Ant-Man have the 10th

The list of 10 films concludes Fifty Shades of Grey with eight, Minions with 7, Avengers: Age of Ultron, also with seven faults.

"Through the years we are all witnessing great movies that just fly under the radar, according to an unofficial voting poll on the movie site IMDb.com, these are the top 10 on that list:

10. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind– Sam Rockwell is brilliant as the

game show impresario/CIA hitman Chuck Barris.

9. 25th Hour – Powerfull drama by Spike Lee, featuring Edvard Norton as New York drug dealer.

8. Before Sunrise – boy meets girl in a train, enough said

7.Falling down– Michale Douglas as a unstable man set to fix the flaws in the world.

6. The Thin red Line – War drama nominated for 7 Oscars, with Nick Nolte, Sean Penn…

5. Jackie Brown – Tarantino’s least famous movie, nevertheless worth watching.

4.Equilibrium – My favorite on this list, Sci-fi action about a utopian society where every emotion is illegal.

3. Miller’s Crossing – Prohibition-era thriller by Coen brothers.

2. Zodiac – Dark mystery thriller about the infamous Zodiac killer, with Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr.

1. Into the Wild – True story about a college student and athlete Christopher McCandless, who abandoned everything to live in the wilderness of Alaska.

"It looked like a typical clothing hook, attached to the back of the door leading into a changing room for families at the North Branch YMCA.

But there was a pinhole camera hidden inside, police say, and from where it was placed, it had a clear view of most of the room.

The camera was discovered when a woman accidentally knocked it to the floor on Monday. She turned it over to police.

“There is no explicit images of any children” in the footage discovered on the camera, Lt. Randy Reynolds of the Wichita Police Department’s sex crimes unit said Friday.

Reynolds would not say what the footage contains, only that a time stamp indicates it was shot between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. June 10.

The footage could not be viewed or accessed remotely, Reynolds said.

Investigators want to hear from anyone who used the changing room at that time so they can identify who is on the footage. People are asked to call the sex crimes unit at 316-268-4157 or 316-268-4137.

Police also want to hear from anyone who noticed suspicious behavior at the North Branch Y at 3330 N. Woodlawn late last week. Those people can call the sex crimes unit or Crime Stoppers at 316-267-2111.

Investigators aren’t sure how long the camera had been in the changing room, Reynolds said, but there is no footage earlier than June 10. The black clothing hook is about 4 1/2 inches tall and 1 1/2 inches wide.

The hook used an adhesive on the back. The camera can be purchased off the Internet for about $40, Reynolds said.

“The device is not something that would stand out,” Reynolds said. “It’s certainly something that could have shown up anywhere.”

That’s why police are making the device containing the hidden camera public.

“They could be in changing rooms anywhere,” he said, including clothing stores and health clubs.

“Certainly, there’s no legitimate purpose for putting up something like that,” Reynolds said, adding that it’s “alarming” that the device is so readily available.

“Don’t just assume that because you’re behind closed doors that it’s private,” he said.

YMCA officials searched their branches around the Wichita metropolitan area and found no other hidden cameras, he said.

Shelly Conrady, communications director for the Greater Wichita YMCA, said it was the first time a secret recording device had been found in a local YMCA locker room.

She said YMCA employees are now being trained to detect hidden cameras and are being asked to conduct regular checks of locker rooms.

She said employees are being told that if they do find a hidden device, they should leave it alone and notify YMCA officials.

“We are taking this very seriously,” Conrady said. “The safety and privacy of our members are a top priority.”

Joe Oxler, the manager of the Rock Road branch of Genesis Health Clubs, called news of the camera hidden inside a clothing hook “shocking” and “disturbing.”

Employees perform checks of locker rooms every 30 minutes “to keep an eye on anything like that,” Oxler said, as well as pick up towels and wipe down counters.

Members are forbidden to use cellphones inside the locker rooms because so many now have cameras as well, Oxler said.

Employees have been told to “keep an extra eye out” in the wake of news about the hidden camera, Oxler said.

“It can be tough,” he said. “We’re not in that locker room 24 hours a day.”

"It looked like a typical clothing hook, attached to the back of the door leading into a changing room for families at the North Branch YMCA.

But there was a pinhole camera hidden inside, police say, and from where it was placed, it had a clear view of most of the room.

The camera was discovered when a woman accidentally knocked it to the floor on Monday. She turned it over to police.

“There is no explicit images of any children” in the footage discovered on the camera, Lt. Randy Reynolds of the Wichita Police Department’s sex crimes unit said Friday.

Reynolds would not say what the footage contains, only that a time stamp indicates it was shot between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. June 10.

"​Employees are alleging​ the factory is like a “sweat shop​.”

The factory where Kylie Jenner’s makeup line, Kylie Cosmetics, is made is under fire today. RadarOnline.com reports that employees at Spatz Laboratories in Oxnard, California, are alleging a harmful work environment on career site Indeed.com.

One employee writes that the makeup actually made her sick: “Early morning shifts long hours…was only provided with the lab coat, hair net, and safety glasses. No benefits…I love that I could see how makeup was made from start to finished but the downfall is that the make up particles made me cough and sick.”

Another claimed the work environment was “unclean” and “minimum wage was about all you can get.”

A rep for Spatz Laboratories told RadarOnline.com: “Spatz Laboratories has over 60 years of experience in manufacturing and has always maintained the highest level of standards according to United States labor laws.

“Spatz Laboratories is an equal opportunity employer that is committed to ensuring compliance with all federal and state laws as they apply to the fair treatment and the safe work environment of its team members. This includes but is not limited to all Wage and Hour, Fair Labor Standards, Worker’s Compensation and OSHA regulations. We take pride in the fact that as a company we have had significant success in developing team members and provide them with long-term careers if they choose.”

Not all the comments about Spatz Laboratories were bad. One wrote that “it’s a respectful environment where most employees were happy to be there.”

"It’s been a long battle towards self-acceptance for Alicia Keys. The 35-year-old singer penned an empowering letter about her new choice to not wear makeup.

In the letter, Keys explains how she battled with the scrutiny she faced when she was thrust into the forefront of the music industry. “I started, more than ever, to become a chameleon. Never fully being who I was, but constantly changing so all the “they’s” would accept me,” she writes.

Before her new album, though, Keys started to list “all the things that I was sick of” which included the idea of beauty standards.

“One of the many things I was tired of was the constant judgment of women. The constant stereotyping through every medium that makes us feel like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you’re plus-size,” she writes. “Or the constant message that being sexy means being naked. All of it is so frustrating and so freakin’ impossible. I realized that during this process, I wrote a lot of songs about masks filled with metaphors about hiding. I needed these songs because I was really feeling those insecurities.”

Now that Keys is back to the forefront in the promotion of new music on the way, Keys was feeling it all over again. But with the help of meditation and a photographer by the name of Paola who captured her without makeup, she was able to recognize her new purpose. The photo also became the “In Common” single art.

“I felt powerful because my initial intentions realized themselves. My desire to listen to myself, to tear down the walls I built over all those years, to be full of purpose, and to be myself!” she writes. “The universe was listening to those things I’d promised myself, or maybe I was just finally listening to the universe, but however it goes, that’s how this whole #nomakeup thing began. Once the photo I took with Paola came out as the artwork for my new song ‘In Common,’ it was that truth that resonated with others who posted #nomakeup selfies in response to this real and raw me.”

"UNHEARD AND OVERLOOKED BY THE DEMOCRATS (AND MANY REPUBLICANS), BLUE COLLAR MEN ARE TIRED OF BEING IGNORED

There’s a massive demographic that is quietly FED UP with Hillary’s nonsense. They’re tired, angry, and love what Trump has to say.

POWELLTON, W.Va. — Deep in the belly of an Appalachian mountain, a powerful machine bored into the earth, its whirring teeth clawing out a stream of glistening coal. Men followed inside the Maple Eagle No. 1 mine, their torches cutting through the dank air. One guided the machine with a PlayStation-like controller; others bolted supports in the freshly cut roof.

They were angry. The coal industry that made West Virginia prosperous has been devastated. Every day, it seemed, another mine laid off workers or closed entirely. Friends were forfeiting their cars, homes, and futures.

For these men, this season’s presidential campaign boils down to a single choice. “I’m for Trump,” said Dwayne Riston, 27, his face smeared in dust. “Way I see it, if he wins, we might at least stand a chance of surviving.”

Few places in America offer such a simple electoral calculus as the rolling, tree-studded hills of West Virginia.

Even as Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, lags badly in crucial swing states and loses his grip on white male voters over all, he remains on solid ground here with his promise to “bring back coal.” The fact that his Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton, said in March, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” has helped, too.

But this is not just about economics. West Virginia’s coal country is part of the broader white, working-class vote that has coalesced around a single candidate, Mr. Trump, like never before. His support here stems from a profound, decades-in-the-making sense of political and cultural alienation that has left people feeling distant from their leaders, and even from fellow Americans.

“I kind of feel that people are looking down on us,” said Neil Hanshew, a miner, voicing a common sentiment. “They’re looking at us like we’re a bunch of dumb hillbillies who can’t do anything else.”

"Filmmaker claims Republican nominee is self-sabotaging campaign he launched as a negotiating tactic.

Michael Moore has claimed that Donald Trump never wanted to be president but began his campaign as a way to gain leverage while negotiating a new deal with NBC. While the director did not name his sources, he wrote in The Huffington Post, “there are certain people reading this right now, they know who they are, and they know that every word in the following paragraphs actually happened.”

“In the end, young people, women, blacks, and Hispanics are going to rule this country. That’s why I’m an optimist,” filmmaker says

According to Moore, Trump was unhappy with the money he was making as host and star of The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice, and believed a presidential bid — and all the attention it would garner — would prove to NBC that he was worth millions more than what he was being paid. However, Trump’s plan immediately backfired when he launched his campaign with an infamous press conference where he called Mexicans “rapists” and “drug dealers,” and pledged to build a border wall. NBC immediately fired him.

Trump nevertheless stuck with his plan as a way to increase his value in the eyes of other television networks. Both the candidate and those in his circle believed he wouldn’t win many primaries, let alone the nomination or the presidency.

But as Trump’s polls surged, his campaign became a media sensation and he actually started winning, Trump supposedly put aside his search for a better TV deal and relished the near-universal attention. Moore, however, pointed to Trump’s uncharacteristically restrained speech after winning the New Jersey primary and clinching the Republican nomination as the moment the ruse finally caught up with him.

“No energy, no happiness, just the realization that now he was going to have to go through with this stunt that he started. It was no longer going to be performance art. He was going to have to go to work.”

While Moore wrote that Trump’s increasingly detrimental gaffes over the past several weeks — fighting with Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, suggesting second amendment supporters stop Hillary Clinton — could be considered karma, the director theorized it might actually be self-sabotage.

“Many now are sensing the end game here because they know Trump seriously doesn’t want to do the actual job — and, most importantly, he cannot and WILL NOT suffer through being officially and legally declared a loser — LOSER! — on the night of November 8th.”

Moore closed his piece with a personal message to Trump urging him to bow out soon so that the Republicans could nominate Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney, lose the presidency and perhaps with it the House of Representatives, the Senate and Supreme Court. “Don’t be too hard on yourself,” Moore added. “You’re only the logical conclusion to a party that has lived off the currency of racism and bigotry and fellating the one percent for decades, and now their Trump has come home to roost.”

"In a speech in Dimondale, Michigan, on Friday directed at winning over black voters, Donald Trump detoured from his prepared remarks in order to tell black voters that their lives are terrible and can only be improved by voting for Donald Trump.

“What do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump?” he said. “What do you have to lose? You’re living in poverty; your schools are no good; you have no jobs; 58 percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?”

Never mind that Trump—who recently polled at 1 percent among black voters in a nationwide survey—was treating black people as a monolithic group of poor, unemployed people. His ad-libbed “what the hell do you have to lose” line sounded very much like Trump thinks he knows what’s better for black voters than they know for themselves.

Compare Trump’s actual statements with his prepared remarks and you can see how badly he went off the rails:

Look at how much African-American communities have suffered under Democratic Control. To those hurting, I say: what do you have to lose by trying something new?

There were other moments where Trump veered wildly off-script in a way that seemed absurd. Specifically, Trump said that he would not just win this election, but win re-election in 2020 with 95 percent of black voters supporting him—again, earlier this month Trump’s polling among black voters was somewhere between 1 and 4 percent.

“At the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get 95 percent of the African-American vote,” he said. “I promise you, because I will produce for the inner cities and I will produce for the African-Americans.” Source :http://www.slate.com/

"A super-PAC backing Hillary Clinton has accepted $200,000 in donations from a company holding multiple contracts with the federal government — despite a ban on such contributions.

Boston-based Suffolk Construction made two contributions of $100,000 to Priorities USA, which is backing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.

At the time it made the contributions, Suffolk held multiple contracts worth $976,560 with the Department of Defense for maintenance and construction projects at a Naval base in Newport, R.I., and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., according to the government website USASpending.gov.

Suffolk — which, by Forbes’s estimate, brings in some $2 billion in revenue annually — also donated $10,000 in 2015 to Right to Rise, a super-PAC that supported Republican Jeb Bush’s now-defunct presidential bid.

The donations from Suffolk highlight how a 70-year-old campaign finance law meant to prevent pay-to-play deals between public officials and companies making money from the government is often ignored by those making the donations and those on the receiving end.

The two contributions, one made in July and one in December, came during Clinton’s presidential primary battle with Bernie Sanders, who rose to prominence partly because he railed against super-PACs and the wealthy donors who fund them. The two Suffolk donations to Priorities USA were initially highlighted in a story by the Center for Public Integrity.

A review of campaign finance records by The Hill shows that the practice of skirting or openly flouting the contractor ban has become widespread in both congressional and presidential politics.

There are multiple reasons why the law is ignored.

Some lawyers believe the prohibition on a contractor giving to a super-PAC is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has never issued a ruling on the specific matter.

Perhaps more importantly, donors face little chance of being penalized by a Federal Election Commission (FEC) that is so divided between its Republican and Democratic members it has proved incapable of deciding even the most basic questions, such as whether to investigate complaints.

Priorities USA stipulates on its website that donors can’t be federal contractors. Yet a spokesman for the super-PAC declined to comment in response to a question about whether the donations from Suffolk would be returned.

Clinton’s campaign also declined to comment.

“The increasing trend of contractors violating the law comes as no surprise,” said Craig Holman of Public Citizen, an advocacy group that was involved in a high-profile case regarding the ban.

In addition to the donations to Priorities USA, The Hill found 14 federal contractors that had contributed a total of $173,250 to Right to Rise. Two had also given to Conservative Solutions PAC, a group that supported Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) bid for president.

One contractor, a Florida utility named Gulf Power Co., gave $44,000 to Right to Rise in March 2015. At the time, the company held more than $1 million in contracts with the Department of Defense.

The Hill asked Gulf Power whether the company was aware it was in violation of the ban and if it believed there was a conflict of interest in politicians benefiting from donations from federal contractors.

Jeff Rogers, a spokesman for the company, responded, “We believe Gulf Power’s right to make the contribution in question is constitutionally protected.”

Suffolk Construction, which since 2008 has received $169.7 million in federal contracts, according to USASpending.­gov, declined multiple requests for comment.

John Fish, the company’s CEO, has been a prolific donor to both parties over the years, though FEC records show he favors Democrats by a wide margin. He’s contributed thousands to President Obama’s White House bids and gave $500 to his 2004 Senate campaign.

Fish’s office did not return a request for comment.

The company itself has mainly funneled money to Republicans. In 2012 it gave $510,000 to Restore Our Future, a super-PAC supporting GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, and $50,000 to another group backing then-Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.).

Campaign finance lawyers say federal contractors that donate to super-PACs are taking a calculated risk that the politically deadlocked FEC will never take action against them.

History suggests they’re correct.

In 2012, a Los Angeles Times investigation found that a number of companies with federal contracts, including Suffolk Construction, had, at that point, contributed $890,000 to Restore Our Future.

None of the federal contractors were ever punished for their super-PAC donations.

A top official who worked for Romney’s now-defunct super-PAC declined to comment. Officials who worked for the Bush and Rubio super-PACs also declined to comment.

There are also loopholes in the federal contractor ban. The biggest allows employees and corporate officers of companies with federal contracts to contribute to any candidate or committee of their choosing. They can also establish super-PACs in the name of their own company.

Another way around the federal contractor ban is colloquially known as the “Chevron loophole” and gives contractors with multiple subsidiaries the freedom to make political contributions through business entities not named on the government contracts.

In 2013 Public Citizen filed a complaint with the FEC against the oil giant Chevron, which had held hundreds of federal contracts worth $1.5 billion. The complaint centered on a $2.5 million contribution it made to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super-PAC linked to then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) that was committed to electing House GOP candidates.

In a 5-1 decision, the FEC ruled that the company’s contribution was legal because the federal contract went to a subsidiary, Chevron USA, which is distinct from Chevron, the entity that made the contribution.

The two Chevron entities share a headquarters in San Ramon, Calif.

A spokeswoman for Chevron declined to comment for this article.

Holman said the extraordinary development is that following the ruling, federal contractors aren’t even bothering to take advantage of the loophole, knowing they are unlikely to face any repercussions.

“Contractors now may circumvent the law either by creating an artificial division within the company for the purpose of making contributions, or even not bother with such machinations and make direct contributions and can still feel assured they will not be prosecuted by a deadlocked FEC for violating the law,” he told The Hill.

The federal contractor ban survived a legal challenge in 2015 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the law in a suit against the FEC.

Writing for the 11-judge panel, Chief Judge Merrick Garland — now President Obama’s nominee to the Supreme Court — wrote that the ban is a necessary defense against corruption.

“The statute was itself the outgrowth of a decades-long congressional effort to prevent corruption and ensure the merit-based administration of the national government,” Garland wrote. “And it was followed by subsequent scandals that led to further legislative refinements, again motivated by concerns over corruption and merit protection.”

Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a campaign finance watchdog that has been working on fighting the influence of money in politics for four decades, said that the current open flouting of the federal contractor ban is emblematic of a much larger problem.

“Every political operative and campaign know that the FEC will not enforce the campaign finance laws,” Wertheimer said.

“There’s an old line: ‘If you don’t have enforcement of laws, you do not have the laws.’

“And that’s what we’re dealing with.”

"FLOOD VICTIMS WELCOME TRUMP IN LOUISIANA

As you know, Donald Trump stepped in as our President today to visit the families in Louisiana while our current “President” golfs.

Watch them welcome him!

Louisiana flood victims were thrilled to greet Republican Donald Trump and running mate Mike Pence today in Louisiana.

Trump was greeted like a rock star.

One woman told Donald Trump, “We knew you’d be here!”

"On Thursday, President Trump announced the United States’s intent to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, which was negotiated in a 2015 meeting and dictates that all signatory countries must work together to keep global temperatures from rising to 2 degrees Celsius above those of the pre-Industrial Revolution world.

This decision was met with an unsurprisingly large amount of backlash spanning the globe, but it was also met with an unsurprising measure of support from Republicans here in the United States. Now, however, it’s clear that a number of those Republicans supporting the exit from the Paris Accord did so while being massively indebted to the oil and gas industry on account of millions of dollars of campaign contributions from said industry between them.

A short time ago, on May 25, a number of Republican Senators sent a letter to President Trump calling on him to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. Those Senators were led by Oklahoma’s Jim Inhofe, who posted a press release about the GOP Senators’ urgings on his website.

These Senators cast their call for Trump to exit the Paris Agreement in the light of domestic policy, saying that it was necessary for Trump to exit the deal in order to fully implement his planned repeal of the Obama era Clean Power Plan.

Well guess what? Underscoring just how much Republicans like Sen. Inhofe prioritize concerns of corporate profits over those of protecting the lives and well-being of Americans, Sen. Inhofe has received at least $1,824,177 from the oil and gas industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

In the CPR’s breakdown of the numbers, the oil and gas industries are the industries with the largest overall contributions to Sen. Inhofe over the course of his decades long career.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also signed onto Sen. Inhofe’s aforementioned letter, and although it’s not the top industry in terms of contributions to McConnell, the oil and gas industries have apparently gifted him with at least $1,975,245 over the course of his career, with a massive chunk of that coming just in the last election cycle.

This same trend continues on through the records of the other Senators who signed onto the letter posted about on Sen. Inhofe’s website.

Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who is the second in command Republican in the Senate and was at one point in line to become the next FBI Director, has received over $3 million from the oil and gas industries over the course of his career, making that that the single largest source for campaign cash for Cornyn.

Check out a list of most of the rest of the Senators who signed onto Inhofe’s letters and the respective amounts they’ve received from the oil and gas industries below. The oil and gas industries contribute to Republicans far more often than they contribute to Democrats.

Senator Roy Blunt: $1,143,574

Senator John Boozman: $281,352

Senator Thad Cochran: $462,890

Senator Mike Crapo: $440,937

Senator Ted Cruz: $2,484,520

Senator Tim Scott: $523,276

Senator Richard Shelby: $532,846

Senator Thom Tillis: $263,400

Senator Roger Wicker: $686,876

While these Republicans continue to live in their bubble and make decisions while high off money, the rest of us are left to deal with the consequences.

Ryan’s feelings on the Paris Agreement aside, his tweets prove that he has absolutely no sense of decorum and etiquette in being sensitive to how the people he is supposed to represent actually feel. Moreover, while he may get to opine however he likes, he doesn’t get to be disrespectful. To the world leaders who sincerely believe the agreement is truly a happy medium that represents all parties with the paramount interest of preserving the Earth in mind, his tweets are in extremely poor taste and beyond disrespectful.

"In the wake of Donald Trump’s “covfefe” debacle, efforts to bring Election 2016 back to life by tweeting about Hillary Clinton, and ongoing display of his infatuation with President Obama, one would think that anyone remotely associated with Trump would stay off Twitter. Nope.

With emotions running high worldwide Thursday evening regarding Trump’s decision to back out of the Paris Agreement, Paul Ryan somehow thought it would be a good idea to flippantly tweet about it. Ryan essentially said that caring about the Earth was bad for America (even though America is part of the Earth).

He went on to victimize the U.S., which — at a time when some of the nation’s closest allies are feeling jilted — won’t fare well for foreign relations. To be exact, Ryan tweeted:

Retweet to agree → The #ParisAgreement was simply a raw deal for America. pic.twitter.com/WZckV4cgSd — Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) June 1, 2017

However, the insult to injury, salt to the already festering wound and straw that broke the camel’s back was Ryan’s bold claim that the agreement would hurt the American middle class and the poor. As if he has a track record of showing that he cares for anyone who isn’t rich, Ryan also tweeted:

The #ParisAgreement would have driven up the cost of energy, hitting middle-class & low-income Americans the hardest. — Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) June 2, 2017

Twitter wasn’t having it. Some people simply wanted Ryan to stop spewing nonsense:

"This is honestly ridiculous. Ivanka Trump decided that it was fitting for her to take to Twitter to comment on Pride Month late this Thursday, and boy did Twitter rightfully drag her for thinking that way. (Pride Month is June, which began Thursday.)

Ivanka’s tweet is remarkably patronizing, painting the need for LGBT people to be respected just the same as everyone else in light of the economic contributions that they have lent to the United States.

Ivanka wrote, “I am proud to support my LGBTQ friends and the LGBTQ Americans who have made immense contributions to our society and economy.”

I am proud to support my LGBTQ friends and the LGBTQ Americans who have made immense contributions to our society and economy. — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) June 2, 2017

The problem here is that, as indicated above, it’s totally and utterly irrelevant for Ivanka to mention the “immense contributions to our society and economy” of LGBT people while addressing a time that has been set aside to advocate for LGBT people to be accepted just the same as everyone else.

LGBT people should be accepted and respected just the same as everyone else because they are human beings, with no regard to the size of their positive financial impact on the economy. Ivanka, however, like her family and like so many others, simply sees everything through a money colored lens.

Besides the remarkable shallowness of her statements when taken by themselves, there’s also the issue of the fact that Ivanka Trump works for literally one of the most anti-LGBT administrations in recent memory.

How can she speak as though she’s in a position to advocate for the rights of LGBT people when the administration that she helped inaugurate has struck fear into the hearts of untold numbers of LGBT youth across the nation on account of its support of things like gay conversion therapy?

How can she speak as though she’s some sort of advocate for LGBT people when she’s not spoken out against her father’s administration’s work to upend the rights of LGBT people through such measures as trying to get discrimination legalized nationally?

Twitter, like it does so often, let the hypocrite Ivanka have a piece of its mind.

Check out some of the best replies to Ivanka’s tweet below. (There’re a lot.)

"On Thursday, President Trump announced that he was pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement. Shortly after this declaration, Vice President Mike Pence posted a string of messages on Twitter defending his boss’ decision.

First, Pence argued that by leaving the agreement, Trump was doing his best to follow through with his campaign promises.

‘Since the first day of this administration, @POTUS has been working tirelessly to keep the promises that he made to the American people.’

Since the first day of this administration, @POTUS has been working tirelessly to keep the promises that he made to the American people. — Vice President Pence (@VP) June 1, 2017

It’s true: Trump did promise to pull the U.S. out of the agreement if elected. However, it’s not clear how many people actually wanted him to carry out that promise.

Pence followed the above message up with a video of the address he delivered in response to Trump’s actions, accompanied by the following caption:

‘By his action today, @POTUS Donald Trump is choosing to put the forgotten men and women of America first.’

He also shared a video from the White House calling the Paris Agreement a “bad deal for America.”

‘The Paris Accord is a bad deal for Americans, and @POTUS’ action today is keeping his promise to put American workers first.’

It didn’t take long for Pence’s followers –the very people he claimed Trump was protecting when he opted out of the agreement — to let him know exactly how they feel about this decision.

Plenty of commenters lamented the fact that the U.S. is now going to be left behind as the rest of the world works towards combatting climate change.

Several others pointed out something Trump’s administration can’t seem to wrap their heads around: economic growth, which they claim will come from removing climate regulations, ceaces to matter if the damage done to the Earth makes it uninhabitable.

Trump and Pence might be celebrating the decision to take the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, but the rest of the country — and much of the world, surely — is obviously less than thrilled.

"On Thursday, President Trump announced that he was pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement. Shortly after this declaration, Vice President Mike Pence posted a string of messages on Twitter defending his boss’ decision.

First, Pence argued that by leaving the agreement, Trump was doing his best to follow through with his campaign promises.

‘Since the first day of this administration, @POTUS has been working tirelessly to keep the promises that he made to the American people.’

Since the first day of this administration, @POTUS has been working tirelessly to keep the promises that he made to the American people. — Vice President Pence (@VP) June 1, 2017

It’s true: Trump did promise to pull the U.S. out of the agreement if elected. However, it’s not clear how many people actually wanted him to carry out that promise.

Pence followed the above message up with a video of the address he delivered in response to Trump’s actions, accompanied by the following caption:

‘By his action today, @POTUS Donald Trump is choosing to put the forgotten men and women of America first.’

By his action today, @POTUS Donald Trump is choosing to put the forgotten men and women of America first. https://t.co/2l9CaP7hqT — Vice President Pence (@VP) June 1, 2017

He also shared a video from the White House calling the Paris Agreement a “bad deal for America.”

‘The Paris Accord is a bad deal for Americans, and @POTUS’ action today is keeping his promise to put American workers first.’

It didn’t take long for Pence’s followers –the very people he claimed Trump was protecting when he opted out of the agreement — to let him know exactly how they feel about this decision.

Plenty of commenters lamented the fact that the U.S. is now going to be left behind as the rest of the world works towards combatting climate change.

Such a travesty. All that work, as the rest of the world moves towards clean energy USA gets left behind. — GooRee (@GooRee) June 1, 2017

Trump turned the world against us. He is a traitor and the worst president we've ever seen. He just verified he doesn't care about health. — SCROTUS (@_NotFakeNews_) June 1, 2017

Several others pointed out something Trump’s administration can’t seem to wrap their heads around: economic growth, which they claim will come from removing climate regulations, ceaces to matter if the damage done to the Earth makes it uninhabitable.

"On Thursday, President Trump officially announced that he was pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement, agreement made with the purpose to “strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.”

When Trump delivered a speech regarding the decision in the Rose Garden this afternoon, he seemed to be very pleased with himself for fulfilling yet another one of his many troubling campaign promises –though the president may change his tune when he sees the cover of the Friday edition of the New York Daily News.

On Thursday evening, the Daily News shared a picture of Friday’s front page on Twitter. The cover will feature a photo of President Trump that is partially covered by the following message:

‘Trump to World: Drop Dead Pulls America out of historic climate pact Decides to hell with science, Earth’s future.’

Here’s Friday’s front page…

TRUMP TO WORLD: DROP DEADhttps://t.co/ABouABfDip pic.twitter.com/34twNIQg2J — New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) June 1, 2017

Clearly, the Daily News is not pleased with the president’s latest decision.

While Trump is not going to be happy when he sees the Daily News‘s response, this upcoming cover is certainly not the harshest criticism he has received thus far.

As a result of leaving the Paris Agreement, the president has already lost the support of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until today was serving on Trump’s advisory council. Musk made his announcement via Twitter, saying that leaving the Paris agreement was not good for the U.S. or the world.

‘Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.’

Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017

General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt also condemned Trump’s choice and echoed Musk’s statement about the reality of climate change.

‘Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.’

President Trump has openly denied the existence of climate change on multiple occasions, even going so far as to call it a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese. He carried those opinions over into the White House as well, as was made clear by his cringe-worthy Earth Day tweet about not letting environmental protection impede economic growth.

I am committed to keeping our air and water clean but always remember that economic growth enhances environmental protection. Jobs matter! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2017

With all this in mind, it’s not surprising that Trump did what he did today. However, his choice remains troubling nonetheless — and he will not be remembered fondly for it.

"When given the opportunity to show that he will make a decision and give honest reasons for that choice, Donald Trump appears to have once again failed. During his Paris Agreement exit speech, and subsequent comments, it appears Trump made a number of false statements that in many cases, are just too glaring to be considered incidents of him merely misspeaking.

One major note that caused Trump to get trolled and seemingly put in his place was his insensitive and tactless remark about how he represents the people of Pittsburgh, “not the people of Paris.” Adding to that insulting remark, Sean Spicer later tweeted that Trump said he was “elected by the people of Pittsburgh.”

This quickly led to the mayor of Pittsburgh getting on Twitter and pointing out that the majority of Pittsburgh’s citizens actually voted for Hillary Clinton:

Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton https://t.co/cibJyT7MAK — bill peduto (@billpeduto) June 1, 2017

Bill Peduto isn’t the only person checking the accuracy of Trump’s statements. POLITIFACT also did some research into the assertions Trump made. A larger number of Donald Trump’s claims were either false or based on flawed information.

For example, at one point Trump said the Paris agreement would cause:

‘. . .lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories and vastly diminished economic production.’

It’s claims like this that have Trump supporters all up in arms about the agreement and despite worldwide outrage at the United States’ withdrawal, has caused some to remain faithful in their support of Trump. However, even with all of the negative statistics that Donald Trump cited, he played a major game of semantics and provided information based off a number of assumptions that can’t feasibly be made.

In the case of Trump’s claim above, his information is based off of highly flawed data.

Playing into so-called patriots love for hating all things and people that/who aren’t American, Donald Trump also made the outlandish argument below:

‘China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.’

POLITIFACT found – that is a lie. Nowhere in the agreement does it say that China will be able to build “hundreds of coal plants.” Actually each participating country shows transparency around what it will do to cut down on greenhouse gases. For that reason, it doesn’t allow or not allow specific actions at all; this includes building coal plants.

Furthermore, China is working towards not building any new coal plants. Earlier this year, the country halted the construction of 103 coal plants. Per the usual, Trump played on his un/misinformed supporters’ emotions and simply told them what they wanted to hear.

Finally, Trump declared:

‘Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree. Think of that; this much Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount.’

Straight semantics; without context, this argument is moot. Trump’s “tiny, tiny amount,” is actually pretty big when you think of every participating entity doing their part to reduce emissions. This is especially true since addressing climate issues requires a series of steps and little things mean a lot when you’re talking about a collective effort.

Furthermore, John Reilly, Co-Director of the Joint Program on Science and Policy of Global Change at MIT, pointed out that backing out of the Paris Agreement means that the U.S. will actually have to work harder to honor its commitment to the Earth because America will be acting alone, as opposed to alongside a team of countries dedicated to preserving the global environment.

While the above is in no way a comprehensive list of Trump’s blatant lies, lies of omission, and lies by deception, it does serve as a harsh reminder that Trump will say anything, even if it isn’t true, to get his base to rally around him.

"Hours after President Trump formally announced his plans to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a reactionary statement.

During a Thursday afternoon White House press conference, Trump officially confirmed that the United States will be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord.

Several political bigwigs have responded to Trump’s irresponsible and unconscionable decision — including the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.

In a statement released following President Trump’s press conference, Trudeau begins:

‘We are deeply disappointed that the United States federal government has decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.’

The Prime Minister went on to say that Canada is committed to supporting “clean economic growth” and putting effort into fighting climate change, adding that “Canadians know we need to take decisive and collective action to tackle the many harsh realities of our changing climate.”

Trudeau isn’t alone in his feelings. Former President Barack Obama also expressed his disappointment in Trump’s decision, citing that clean energy was actually generating job growth while protecting the planet that we all have to live on in the process.

President Obama said in his statement:

‘Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future. And for the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale.’

Trudeau’s statement doesn’t come as much of a shock, considering that he’s a known advocate for environmental awareness and clean energy. The Canadian leader continued:

‘This is not only about the huge economic opportunities of clean growth and the need to address the pressing threats of climate change. This is about an ambitious and unshakable desire to leave a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable planet for our kids and for generations to come.’

Trudeau assured in closing that despite Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, Canada will continue to work with as well as encourage the U.S. federal government to consider placing more importance on climate change and environmental protection in the years to come:

‘We are all custodians of this world, and that is why Canada will continue to work with the U.S. at the state level, and with other U.S. stakeholders, to address climate change and promote clean growth. We will also continue to reach out to the U.S. federal government to discuss this matter of critical importance for all humankind, and to identify areas of shared interest for collaboration, including on emissions reductions’

"Hours after President Trump formally announced his plans to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a reactionary statement.

During a Thursday afternoon White House press conference, Trump officially confirmed that the United States will be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord.

Several political bigwigs have responded to Trump’s irresponsible and unconscionable decision — including the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.

In a statement released following President Trump’s press conference, Trudeau begins:

‘We are deeply disappointed that the United States federal government has decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.’

The Prime Minister went on to say that Canada is committed to supporting “clean economic growth” and putting effort into fighting climate change, adding that “Canadians know we need to take decisive and collective action to tackle the many harsh realities of our changing climate.”

Trudeau isn’t alone in his feelings. Former President Barack Obama also expressed his disappointment in Trump’s decision, citing that clean energy was actually generating job growth while protecting the planet that we all have to live on in the process.

"Well, well, well.

Top Republicans have long been pushing for answers as to why several Trump associates were named in foreign surveillance reports under former President Barack Obama’s administration. On Wednesday, a series of subpoenas were issued in the investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Russia, pertaining specifically to Trump insiders Michael Cohen and disgraced National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Said subpoenas “seek information on requests” for the unmasking of several Trump confidantes by Susan Rice, former national security adviser under President Obama.

The House Intelligence Committee, however, didn’t provide details regarding the subpoenas directed toward the intelligence agencies.

Reps. Adam Schiff and Mike Conaway told the Journal:

‘As part of our ongoing investigation into Russian active measures during the 2016 campaign, today we approved subpoenas for several individuals for testimony, personal documents and business records. We hope and expect that anyone called to testify or provide documents will comply with that request, so that we may gain all the information within the scope of our investigation. We will continue to pursue this investigation wherever the facts may lead.’

The problem, it seems, lies in the fact that Democrats on the committee were likely unaware that these subpoenas were issued.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes previously stated that he would recuse himself from the probe into the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Russia after his handling of the investigation sparked ethics concerns from Democrats on the committee.

On May 19, however, Nunes changed his tune and announced that he’d remain active in the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.

A committee aide told the Journal:

‘If the reports are accurate, subpoenas related to the ‘unmasking’ issue would have been sent by Chairman Nunes acting separately from the Committee’s Russia investigation. This action would have been taken without the Minority’s agreement. Any prior requests for information would have been undertaken without the Minority’s knowledge.’

Rep. Nunes ""stepped aside"" from panel's Russia probe in early Apr, but on May 19 he said he'll remain an active chair. This is proof of that https://t.co/V8D2aCQ91a — Kevin Rincon (@KevRincon) May 31, 2017

House Intel subpoenas related to unmasking came from Chairman Nunes unilaterally, w/o Dem knowledge, per source. — Ben Siegel (@benyc) May 31, 2017

President Trump made headlines not long ago with his unsubstantiated claim that Obama wiretapped his Trump Tower phones during the 2016 presidential election. He later tried to defend the allegation by saying former National Security Adviser Susan Rice likely committed a crime by seeking to ‘unmask’ the identities of Trump confidantes involved in surveillance of foreign officials by U.S. spy agencies.

With his decision to remain active in the investigation, Nunes still has the power to issue subpoenas, and only has to consult minority Democrats on the committee in order to do so.

Committee rules give Nunes broad power … only has to ""consult"" minority … altho unmasking as an issue has some support among Rs on panel — Tom LoBianco (@tomlobianco) May 31, 2017

Given the fact that Nunes has been a Trump supporter from the get-go, his decision to reverse course and remain active in the investigation makes perfect sense.

‘I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.’

While Donald Trump likely thought his attempt to use alliteration added to the pizzaz of his speech, Mayor Peduto was not amused. In fact, Peduto in essence, told Trump, don’t speak for my city when he tweeted:

One of the best tweets came from the user below who reminded anyone who has forgotten (Donald Trump and Sean Spicer included), that the Paris Agreement is not about the French city alone, it’s about the world, America included:

Yes, the Paris agreement does take the pollution, global warming, and general environmental concerns of the entire world, into consideration. With that in mind, Trump’s decision to exit means that he doesn’t care about Paris, Pittsburgh, or anywhere in between.

"The Mayor of Pittsburgh, PA, Bill Peduto (D), fired major shots at Donald Trump after Trump used the city’s name in the speech in which he declared that the U.S. will no longer participate in the Paris Agreement. Trump foolishly proclaimed:

‘I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.’

While Donald Trump likely thought his attempt to use alliteration added to the pizzaz of his speech, Mayor Peduto was not amused. In fact, Peduto in essence, told Trump, don’t speak for my city when he tweeted:

As the Mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future. — bill peduto (@billpeduto) June 1, 2017

Peduto must have really been on fire and angry with Trump, because he didn’t stop with the tweet above. He also came out swinging after Sean Spicer posted the message below on behalf of Donald Trump:

.@POTUS “I was elected by voters of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I wld exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve US interests” — Sean Spicer (@PressSec) June 1, 2017

Because Spicer’s tweet again proves that the Trump administration misspeaks on matters that are easily researched from virtually any mobile device, computer, or by even using to phone to call someone who knows, Peduto justifiably checked Spicer on the matter of whom the majority of Pittsburgh residents gave their support to in Election 2016:

Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton — bill peduto (@billpeduto) June 1, 2017

As the Mayor of Pittsburgh, Peduto knows a thing or two about air pollution and the need to control it. The city is in Allegheny County, PA, an area notorious for its struggles with air pollution. In fact, the American Lung Association gave the county a failing grade in its most recent State of the Air, report.

People loved Peduto’s response to the Trump administration, and tweeted their support of the Mayor in bold fashion:

"President Trump sparked international outrage Thursday, when he announced that the United States will be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement. Trump later spoke to members of the press outside the White House, where he addressed the happenings of his Europe trip, which concluded with his arrival in D.C. on Monday.

Later Thursday evening, Trump took to Twitter to share a video clip of his address with his followers. He tweeted:

‘My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field. #AmericaFirst’

The Paris Climate Agreement, signed during the latter portion of former President Barack Obama’s administration, requires countries around the globe work together to reduce annual temperatures from rising above a certain average. Although there is no legal obligation to remain part of the agreement, as one of the most powerful and respected nations on each, Trump’s move makes a direct statement in regards to where the United States’ interests lie. (Hint: They’re not with the planet.)

As many have speculated, the president likely withdrew the U.S. from the agreement in an effort to prioritize making money, either that or as an attempt to undo yet another widely applauded move made by the Obama administration.

In fact, White House energy policy adviser Michael Catanzaro told Capitol Hill staffers in an conference call on Thursday, that the Trump administration is “going to make very clear to the world that we’re not going to be abiding by what the previous administration agreed to.”

Twitter, however, wasn’t having any of Trump’s crap. Some of the best responses to his tweet can be viewed below:

"Donald Trump is displaying his usual ignorant arrogance with regard to the United States’ lack of further participation in the Paris agreement. As part of his haughtiness, he remains totally oblivious to the ongoing fallout his hasty decision will cause. The damage this announcement will have on foreign relations is likely irreparable. However, more important than politics is Trump’s utter disregard for the Earth.

A number of powerful people worldwide have vowed to hold Trump’s feet to the flames about the Paris Agreement, with the first wave of influential people to openly object to Trump’s decision already surfacing. Among those people is Tesla and Space X CEO, Elon Musk.

As one would reasonably expect, the CEO of a company that has taken electric cars to new levels is a staunch advocate for the environment, programs that combat global warming and preserving natural resources. However, despite Donald Trump’s obvious anti-Earth stance, Musk agreed to be part of Trump’s Strategic Policy Forum. Musk was also willing to serve as an adviser to Trump’s manufacturing jobs initiative. Apart from the Trump committee work Musk engaged in, he met with him to discuss spending in relation to infrastructure.

As of Thursday, Musk no longer has anything to do with supporting Trump in an advisory capacity. Musk tweeted:

Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017

Yes, climate change is real, but everyone except Donald Trump and his allies seem to accept and acknowledge that reality.

Thursday’s tweet isn’t the first time Musk has taken to Twitter to express his feelings regarding America’s role in the Paris Agreement. Sounding a bit daunted, Musk tweeted on Wednesday that he felt as if he has done all that he can to inform Trump about the importance of the agreement:

Don’t know which way Paris will go, but I’ve done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017

Showing further disappointment, Musk posted another message after his announcement about resigning from Trump’s councils. While very tactful in his delivery, Musk highlighted China’s commitment to the planet in the midst of Trump’s abandonment of Earth and subsequent lack of concern for what’s left behind for future generations.

Musk isn’t alone in his disappointment. General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt boldly stated that those in industries that have the power to affect change on their own must step up in the midst of the current government’s disregard for this crucial issue:

Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government. — Jeff Immelt (@JeffImmelt) June 1, 2017

With that simple-but-powerful tweet, Americans and people worldwide are further reminded that gone are the days of the commander-in-chief leading from the front — or by example.

"On Thursday afternoon, President Trump officially confirmed the rumors that the United States is withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord in a Rose Garden press conference, and the Weather Channel was one of the many voices to immediately rise up in protest.

The Weather Channel put a link to watch Trump’s Rose Garden remarks live up on its website, the aptly named Weather.com, and below the live-stream link was and remains as of about an hour after the original announcement a series of articles that stand to serve as direct rebuttals to Trump’s decision.

The article titles, when read one after the other, relate a blunt sentiment. The first article is titled, “So, What Happens To Earth Now?” while the second is called on the front page, “Still Don’t Care? Proof You Should.” The remaining articles in the list are called things like “…and More Proof…”

In another universe, one in which Trump’s ridiculous decision didn’t threaten the very stability of the planet that we all call home, this might be funny.

Check out a screenshot of The Weather Channel’s website from late Thursday afternoon below.

The articles that The Weather Channel has tagged with these clever titles tell the stories of various points across the world that are seeing big changes as the climate continues to change under the weight of rising global temperatures.

Under the Paris Climate Accord, the United States pledged, alongside basically every other country in the entire world — minus two — to cut back on carbon dioxide emissions in view of the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising beyond the point of no return.

In the interest of big business, Trump has now announced that the United States will no longer pledge to cut carbon dioxide emissions as we’d pledged to before.

As cited by the first of the Weather Channel’s backhandedly confrontational articles, scientists have estimated that the United States going back on our previous commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions could put some 3 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere a year.

Interestingly, John Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, has actually expressed confidence that the world will move towards saving the planet with or without Trump.

Only time will tell if he’s right.

"On Thursday afternoon, President Trump officially confirmed the rumors that the United States is withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord in a Rose Garden press conference, and the Weather Channel was one of the many voices to immediately rise up in protest.

The Weather Channel put a link to watch Trump’s Rose Garden remarks live up on its website, the aptly named Weather.com, and below the live-stream link was and remains as of about an hour after the original announcement a series of articles that stand to serve as direct rebuttals to Trump’s decision.

The article titles, when read one after the other, relate a blunt sentiment. The first article is titled, “So, What Happens To Earth Now?” while the second is called on the front page, “Still Don’t Care? Proof You Should.” The remaining articles in the list are called things like “…and More Proof…”

In another universe, one in which Trump’s ridiculous decision didn’t threaten the very stability of the planet that we all call home, this might be funny.

Check out a screenshot of The Weather Channel’s website from late Thursday afternoon below.

The articles that The Weather Channel has tagged with these clever titles tell the stories of various points across the world that are seeing big changes as the climate continues to change under the weight of rising global temperatures.

Under the Paris Climate Accord, the United States pledged, alongside basically every other country in the entire world — minus two — to cut back on carbon dioxide emissions in view of the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising beyond the point of no return.

In the interest of big business, Trump has now announced that the United States will no longer pledge to cut carbon dioxide emissions as we’d pledged to before.

As cited by the first of the Weather Channel’s backhandedly confrontational articles, scientists have estimated that the United States going back on our previous commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions could put some 3 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere a year.

Interestingly, John Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, has actually expressed confidence that the world will move towards saving the planet with or without Trump.

Only time will tell if he’s right.

"President Trump has gotten quite a bit of flack for his decision to remove the United States from the Paris climate agreement, but what the CEO of General Electric just tweeted will really get under Trump’s skin.

From the Vatican to President Obama, many political figures have spoken out against Trump’s ridiculous decision, but after the immature move a few weeks ago when he refused to wear his headphones to hear french translators, it was pretty much understood that Trump was only there so he could be photographed.

Jeff Immelt took to Twitter after learning of Trump’s naive choice:

“Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.”

"Once again, President Donald Trump’s tweets have made the headlines with his nonsense Monday night infamous “covfefe” tweet, that had Twitter in a frenzy. To make matters even worse, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer declared that there was an actual meaning behind president’s nonsense, and was mocked big time for it.

Now, Some of Trump’s most loyal supporters actually think the orange man knew what he was talking about, convincing themselves that it means “I will stand up” in Arabic, only to make themselves look like complete and total fools.

Here’s where things get weird. Trump fans at Reddit’s /r/The_Donald made multiple posts stating that they believe the President’s tweet was actually conveying a message of unity to the Afghani government in the after math of this week’s terrorist attacks in Kabul.

One Trumpster said:

‘Cov fe’fe means “I’ll stand up” translated from Arabic! The President God Emperor is giving us hope in troubled times!’

While another one of his delusional supporters thought covfefe was a message meant for the “fake news” media that, “Despite the negative media, I will stand up. Cov fe’ve means “I will stand up” in Arabic. Trump never makes mistakes, you guys.”

Trump also never tweets in Arabic, either.

The madness went on and on with Trump’s minions. Check out some more of their idiotic responses below:

‘So he wanted the media and the leftist retards to think he screwed up. He let them go on and on, while we just had a blast with it. That Magnificent Mad Man.’

‘He’s redpilling them in their own language!’

Cassandra Fairbanks, who is an infamous Trump troll, also joined in, using the supposed meaning to troll Hillary, saying:

‘Cov fe’fe is “I will stand up” in Arabic. It was right after the bombing in Kabul. To quote a failed politician: “Delete your account.”‘

It turns out that every single one of were wrong about the true meaning of “covfefe.” In fact, it turns out that there is no actual meaning to the word at all, and that it was just an error copied from Google Translate.

"After nearly four months in office, it seems that President Trump's fellow conservatives have finally stopped giving him the benefit of the doubt. In fact, they appear to have started to completely turn their backs on him. In..."
"Less than 24 hours ago, White House press secretary Sean Spicer announced that he would no longer be answering questions about the investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with the Russian government to win the 2016 presidential elections. All future questions, Spicer said, should be directed to Trump’s lawyer. This is a standard move when an investigation is underway and a case can be compromised by public statements that might refute later testimony.

That isn’t going to stop Trump from doing his paranoid tweeting thing, though. On Thursday morning, Trump wanted to remind everyone that whenever things go wrong for him and the rest of the GOP, the person to blame is always President Obama.

The big story is the ""unmasking and surveillance"" of people that took place during the Obama Administration. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 1, 2017

Actually, the big story is that the current president may have been elected because he and his campaign team colluded with a hostile foreign country to interfere in the democratic process, thereby committing treason. Leave it to that same president, however, to blame Obama.

No matter how hard Trump tries, he just can’t seem to get the media and the American public to focus on what he wants them to write and discuss.

He also can’t get the intelligence community to just say what he wants them to say. He tried, reportedly, more than once to get former FBI Director James Comey to say publicly that the president is not under investigation. When Comey refused to do so, he was fired.

Another member of that same community, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, explained during a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Russia’s attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election that:

‘An unmasking is a legitimate process that consists of a request and approval by proper authorities…At no time did I ever submit a request for personal or political purposes or to voyeuristically look at raw intelligence nor am I aware of any instance of such abuse by anyone else.’

Today, Trump insists the real problem is the legitimate and legally performed process of unmasking his campaign staff during the elections during Obama’s final term in office. Tomorrow, he’ll say the real problem is leaks coming out of the White House by Obama holdovers on his staff.

No matter what the real problem is, it’s guaranteed that he’ll continue to blame Obama.

"A man staying at the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. was arrested today after unlicensed weapons and ammunition were found in the car he left with a valet.

Bryan Moles of Pennsylvania was found in his room at the hotel where police arrested him for possessing an AR-15 and a Glock 23 with no license for either, as well as 90 rounds of ammunition. Police were alerted by a tip that led them to search the vehicle and arrested Moles.

A local NBC-affiliated news station reported that:

‘According to a charging document, police learned Moles was traveling to Washington, D.C., with a Glock 23 pistol, a Carbon Bushmaster assault rifle and 90 rounds of ammunition in his possession. Police said Moles made threatening remarks, but investigators did not disclose who those threats were directed toward.’

"There are few Americans left defending the appointment of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner to an important position in the White House, much less is anyone confident in his ability to find solutions to some of the world’s toughest problems: restore peace in the Middle East, create criminal justice reform, solve the growing opioid crisis, and serve as a liaison to Mexico, China, and the Muslim world.

Only under Donald Trump would a 36-year-old real estate heir and fake news publication owner be considered qualified to do any of the jobs Kushner is tasked with handling. A former employee of Kushner’s from the New York Observer doesn’t find it surprising at all, actually, considering all of the similarities between Trump and Kushner and their business philosophies.

According to POLITICO:

At the end of the year, when she went to collect her performance bonus at his real estate office for meeting agreed upon metrics on page views and audience growth, Kushner told her that they couldn’t pay, citing financial concerns, and asked her to “take one for the team.” Instead, Kahlon abruptly quit. Every time she sees him on TV or on the streets of New York ever since, she would point him out to people: “There is the guy that stole my money.”’

Like Trump, Kushner apparently finds it perfectly acceptable to hire an employee, promise them pay, then abruptly take back the promise once the job has been completed. It’s a long-standing business practice of Trump’s, as well, and the impetus behind many of the overwhelming number of lawsuits that have been brought against him.

The employee, Harleen Kahlon, didn’t suddenly begin telling this story once Kushner was in the White House, either. She reportedly called out Kushner on Facebook during the whole ordeal.

‘We’re talking about a guy who isn’t particularly bright or hard-working, doesn’t actually know anything, has bought his way into everything ever (with money he got from his criminal father), who is deeply insecure and obsessed with fame (you don’t buy the NYO, marry Ivanka Trump, or constantly talk about the phone calls you get from celebrities if it’s in your nature to ‘shun the spotlight’), and who is basically a shithead.’

It doesn’t make America feel any safer, much less does anyone feel America has become “great again,” with either Kushner or his wife’s father at the helm. Perhaps Kushner, the latest focus of the investigation into Trump’s campaign and their alleged collusion with Russian operatives to influence the 2016 elections, will join his father in prison along with his father-in-law and the rest of the deplorables sitting in the White House today.

At that point, America may truly become great again.

"'The View' co-host Joy Behar calls out Donald Trump on possible treasonous speech.

During a discussion of Donald Trump’s ridiculous response to the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando last weekend, Joy Behar, co-host of “The View” on ABC stunned the audience by proposing that Trump’s words were treasonous. Her remarks elicited an audible gasp of shock from audience members.

The Orlando shooting appears now to be an anti-LGBTQ hate crime, rather than an attack by religious extremists. However, Trump insinuated in remarks to the press that President Obama was avoiding any reference to terrorism by Islamic extremists.

Behar makes an interesting point about the repercussions of Trump’s remarks:

‘Do you think that because he is the “recruiter-in-chief,” and by his words he’s getting more people to go on the side of ISIS, that he could be considered treasonous? ‘I mean, that is against the CONSTITUTION. That is against America. That is a treasonous act in my opinion.’

According to Mother Jones, Trump’s vile anti-Muslim speech is now being used to recruit more fighters for ISIS, appearing in videos distributed to incite rage against the United States as well as a call to war to increase their numbers. His remarks are being used to incite jihad against the very country he proposes to lead.

ISIS propaganda videos distributed earlier this year feature Donald Trump discussing the terrorist attacks on Brussels. Images of dancing flames superimposed over Trump’s face appear, while audio from a Fox News interview with Trump plays in te background”

‘Brussels was one of the great cities…and now it’s a horror show. It’s an ABSOLUTE horror show.’

Captions saying BROTHERS, RISE UP! and LET’S GO, LET’S GO, LET’S GO FOR JIHAD! appear onscreen as the audio plays snippets of Trump’s remarks. The video was allegedly produced and released by the Al-Battar Media Foundation, a pro-ISIS media group.

During the discussion on “The View,” none of the co-hosts on the panel were particularly pleased with Trump’s anti-Islamic, anti-immigrant rhetoric.

Co-host Raven-Symone called for Trump to apologize or drop out of the race for insinuating that President Barack Obama should step down for failing to blame the Orlando shooting on radicalized Islamists.

Raven-Symone said:

‘If you can’t apologize, you need to get out of the race.’

Co-host Whoopi Goldberg, as usual, offered true insight to the problem of domestic terrorism in the U.S., addressed Donald Trump directly:

‘You can’t call for a ban on Americans, ok? Because that’s what you’d have to do, donald. Dylann Roof was an american, this kid was an american. Come on, man.’

Behar had the perfect one-line response:

‘Maybe you should build a wall around queens?’

Watch the video below and note the absolute shock in the audience after Behar questions Trump’s speech as possible treason. It’s something to think about. Is Trump really that naive and gullible, to play right into the hands of ISIS. Or, as he himself accuses President Obama, does Trump have “something else in mind?”

Is Trump really that naive and gullible, to play right into the hands of ISIS. Or, as he himself accuses President Obama, does Trump have “something else in mind?”

"The LA Times published a beautifully written opinion article by former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. He felt the need to explain to his millions of loyal fans that letting Donald Trump win the Presidency was just not an option. Below is the letter.

The conventions are over and the general election has officially begun. In the primaries, I received 1,846 pledged delegates, 46% of the total. Hillary Clinton received 2,205 pledged delegates, 54%. She received 602 superdelegates. I received 48 superdelegates. Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee and I will vigorously support her.

Donald Trump would be a disaster and an embarrassment for our country if he were elected president. His campaign is not based on anything of substance — improving the economy, our education system, healthcare or the environment. It is based on bigotry. He is attempting to win this election by fomenting hatred against Mexicans and Muslims. He has crudely insulted women. And as a leader of the “birther movement,” he tried to undermine the legitimacy of our first African American president. That is not just my point of view. That’s the perspective of a number of conservative Republicans.

In these difficult times, we need a president who will bring our nation together, not someone who will divide us by race or religion, not someone who lacks an understanding of what our Constitution is about.

On virtually every major issue facing this country and the needs of working families, Clinton’s positions are far superior to Trump’s. Our campaigns worked together to produce the most progressive platform in the history of American politics. Trump’s campaign wrote one of the most reactionary documents.

Clinton understands that Citizens United has undermined our democracy. She will nominate justices who are prepared to overturn that Supreme Court decision, which made it possible for billionaires to buy elections. Her court appointees also would protect a woman’s right to choose, workers’ rights, the rights of the LGBT community, the needs of minorities and immigrants and the government’s ability to protect the environment.

Trump, on the other hand, has made it clear that his Supreme Court appointees would preserve the court’s right-wing majority.

Clinton understands that in a competitive global economy we need the best-educated workforce in the world. She and I worked together on a proposal that will revolutionize higher education in America. It will guarantee that the children of any family in this country with an annual income of $125,000 a year or less – 83% of our population – will be able to go to a public college or university tuition free. This proposal also substantially reduces student debt.

Trump, on the other hand, has barely said a word about higher education.

Clinton understands that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, it is absurd to provide huge tax breaks to the very rich.

Trump, on the other hand, wants billionaire families like his to enjoy hundreds of billions of dollars in new tax breaks.

Clinton understands that climate change is real, is caused by human activity and is one of the great environmental crises facing our planet. She knows that we must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and move aggressively to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.

Trump, on the other hand, like most Republicans, rejects science and the conclusions of almost all major researchers in the field. He believes that climate change is a “hoax,” and that there’s no need to address it.

Clinton understands that this country must move toward universal healthcare. She wants to see that all Americans have the right to choose a public option in their healthcare exchange, that anyone 55 or older should be able to opt in to Medicare, and that we must greatly improve primary healthcare through a major expansion of community health centers. She also wants to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs.

And what is Donald Trump’s position on healthcare? He wants to abolish the Affordable Care Act, throw 20 million people off the health insurance they currently have and cut Medicaid for lower-income Americans.

During the primaries, my supporters and I began a political revolution to transform America. That revolution continues as Hillary Clinton seeks the White House. It will continue after the election. It will continue until we create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 percent – a government based on the principle of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.

I understand that many of my supporters are disappointed by the final results of the nominating process, but being despondent and inactive is not going to improve anything. Going forward and continuing the struggle is what matters. And, in that struggle, the most immediate task we face is to defeat Donald Trump."

"After months of obsessive coverage of “Russiagate,” the mainstream media is reminding the world of its hypocrisy once again as it ignores the annual meeting of one of the most secretive and powerful organizations of the global elite — Bilderberg.

The 65th annual Bilderberg Meeting, which has been held in locations around the world throughout the years, kicked off on Thursday in Chantilly, Virginia. Despite a prestigious guest list of around 130 attendees—who will arguably have more of a global influence than a few hypothetical Russian hackers—the meeting has escaped the mainstream media’s radar in the United States.

The guest list boasts a variety of politicians and financiers, including Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund; José Manuel Barroso, chairman of Goldman Sachs International; Jens Stoltenberg, secretary general of NATO; and Cui Tiankai, China’s ambassador to the U.S.

While this year’s location is less than 30 miles from the White House, and the group is set to discuss the current status of the Trump Administration, President Trump himself was not included on the list of expected guests.

The Bilderberg website listed a range of topics to be discussed in 2017, from “The Trump Administration: A progress report,” to “China,” to “Nuclear Proliferation,” to “Russia in the international order,” to “The direction of the EU,” to “The Trans-Atlantic defense alliance: bullets, bytes and bucks.”

While many have branded the global influence that comes as a result of the Bilderberg Meeting as nothing more than a “conspiracy theory,” the event’s website acknowledges its secretive nature by noting that “participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s) nor any other participant may be revealed.”

The topics discussed at each meeting raise legitimate questions about whether the array of politicians who attend are being given their marching orders for the upcoming year. It also serves as a reminder that the Bilderberg Meeting is arguably a violation of the Logan Act, which sets the law for private correspondence with foreign governments in the United States:

“Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.”

Despite the egregious nature of the secrecy surrounding the group, and its possible consequences under U.S. law, elected officials appear as though they couldn’t care less. In fact, Republican Senators, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Tom Cotton from Arkansas, are even included on the guest list.

The mainstream media’s devotion to the possibility that that the Russian government may have influenced the U.S. election would have viewers convinced that it is just getting started in its war on exposing global interference in American interests.

Instead, the MSM have chosen corporate interests over truth, lending its 24/7 coverage to Trump’s latest typo while one of the most influential, secretive meets of the global elite is happening right now on American soil.

Given the history of US officials, media moguls, and others attending this nefarious event, it should come as no surprise that its coverage is absent from your newsfeed.

As the Free Thought Project reported earlier this year, declassified documents expose a decades-long relationship between the secretive elite network and the CIA. Michael Best of Muckrock recently poured through the CREST archives for references to Bilderberg and found a few interesting documents that point to the CIA’s interest in the Bilderberg meetings.

One thing that is not exactly clear is the motive that the CIA had for documenting these meetings, especially considering the fact that the CIA director at the time Allen Dulles, was an associate of the Rockefeller dynasty, who was mentioned by names in these documents. Also, many conference attendees over the years have actually been employed by the CIA. In the recently surfaced documents, the name Paul Nitze is mentioned as a member of the first Bilderberg conference, and just years later he was hired by the agency.

Four years after the fist conference took place, one member of the Bilderberg group actually reached out to Dulles personally to inform him about the meetings. In May of 1958, Joseph Johnson of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Bilderberg Steering Committee sent Dulles a summary of the issues discussed at Bilderberg. Of course, these summaries were not released to the public, but the letters about the summaries were released, which at least give proof of the existence of Bilderberg, although it does not give details of what takes place inside.

The next year, Johnson wrote Dulles again about the Bilderberg group, but this time, it was to discuss his own invitation, confirming that long-time CIA director Allen Dulles was himself involved in the secretive meeting.

Dulles wrote back saying that although he was not able to attend this year, that he had hoped to in the future.

Although these documents only give a glimpse into the agency’s relationship with the Bilderberg group, it does show a clear connection and friendly relations between the two. Several more mentions of Bilderberg appear in the agency’s records, but most of these mentions are in reference to appearances made by CIA agents and US presidents.

These documents are groundbreaking because for so long the US government and mainstream media have denied that these meetings even existed, and now it is proven that at least one agency and multiple presidents had knowledge of these events.

Below is a chart showing exactly how this secretive agency is connected throughout the world."

"In a blow to the anti-Russia narrative being spewed by any and everyone in the western establishment (most recently Hillary again), the head of the French National Agency of Information Systems Security (ANSSI) told AP that France has found no traces of Russian hackers in a cyberattack on President Emmanuel Macron's campaign (we wonder if the result would have been the same if he, like Hillary, had lost).

French Intelligence Head: there is absolutely no evidence of Russian involvement in French Elex hacking. Hack was crude; could be anyone pic.twitter.com/MCpyX87PH8 — Murad Gazdiev (@MuradGazdiev) June 1, 2017

Right after the event, it was claimed (by officials and the media lapdogs) that Russian hacking group called APT28 was responsible for the cyberattack on Macron's presidential campaign.

However, according to ANSSI (the French cybersecurity agency has been investigating the attack) chief Guillaume Poupard,

the hacker attack on Macron's campaign ""was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone."" He told AP that it ""means that we can imagine that it was a person who did this alone. They could be in any country.""

Of course, given Putin's meeting with Macron this week, we are sure the narrative remains alive and well and Putin must have strong-armed Macron to deny this.

As a reminder, the leak of Macron campaign data contained 9 gigabytes of emails, images and attachments dating back several months. At the time, the French authorities called on the national media not to report the contents of the leak, saying that doing so would violate election rules to stop campaigning a day ahead of an election. The candidate also barred RT and the Russia"
"In January, we wrote about a cybernetic micro air vehicle under development at Draper called DragonflEye. DragonflEye consists of a living, slightly modified dragonfly that carries a small backpack of electronics. The backpack interfaces directly with the dragonfly’s nervous system to control it, and uses tiny solar panels to harvest enough energy to power itself without the need for batteries. Draper showed us a nifty looking mock-up of what the system might look like a few months ago, but today, they’ve posted the first video of DragonflEye taking to the air.

The unique thing about DragonflEye (relative to other cyborg insects) is that it doesn’t rely on spoofing the insect’s sensors or controlling its muscles, but instead uses optical electrodes to inject steering commands directly into the insect’s nervous system, which has been genetically tweaked to accept them. This means that the dragonfly can be controlled to fly where you want, without sacrificing the built-in flight skills that make insects the envy of all other robotic micro air vehicles.

It looks like the above video is mostly showing that the electronics and hardware can be interfaced to the insect while still allowing it to fly, so we may not be seeing the control system in action yet. Even so, this research seems to be moving along very, very quickly, and we’re not entirely sure when this video was shot, so our advice is to give every dragonfly you see zipping around outside a second glance, just in case."
"Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has spent the last six years working on a giant aircraft capable of launching rockets to space. Today, his company Stratolaunch Systems literally rolled that plane out of its hangar in the Mojave Desert for the first time ever.

It’s called the Stratolaunch aircraft, and it’s massive. The plane has a 385-foot wingspan, which makes it the largest in the world by that metric. It weighs about 500,000 pounds dry, but that can swell to a maximum takeoff weight of 1.3 million pounds. Stratolaunch moves all that weight across the ground on 28 wheels, and eventually will carry its cargo through the air thanks to six 747 aircraft engines.

Why so big? Allen plans to use the Stratolaunch plane as an airborne rocket launcher. Instead of taking off from a launchpad, which requires lots of fuel, Stratolaunch will give rockets a head start by first carrying them up into the sky. It’s already got one customer, too — private spaceflight company Orbital ATK inked a deal with Stratolaunch Systems last October to use the giant plane as a launcher for its Pegasus XL rocket, which is used to send small satellites into space."
"The issue of “pharmaceutical pollution” was recently highlighted in a study that points to inadequate waste management policies leading to the presence of both pharmaceutical products as well as drug-resistant superbugs in the waters of India.

The study, published in the scientific journal Infection, focused on the environmental impact of drug production in Hyderabad, a city in India that produces 40% of Indian generic drugs and 50% of the country’s exported drugs. India produces about 20% of the world’s generic pharmaceuticals.

This study was conducted to “determine the environmental presence of active anti-infective pharmaceuticals in a major production area for the global bulk drug market” and “document the ongoing environmental pollution by the pharmaceutical industries” in Hyderabad.

Researchers collected water samples from various areas within and around Hyderabad’s industrial district where several drug manufacturing facilities are located. Sampling locations “were chosen to cover the direct vicinity of bulk drug manufacturing facilities, rivers, lakes, ground water, drinking water, water sources contaminated by sewage treatment plants, and surface water from populated urban as well as rural areas,” according to the study.

According to the study, low levels of drugs that include antibiotics have been found in the past to be present in the ground and in drinking water across the globe, and that improper disposal is a major cause of this contamination, including in India.

The study pointed out that India has “become a hot spot of drug resistance” with over 56,000 babies dying yearly “infections by bacteria that are resistant to first-line antibiotics.”

Nearly all of the 28 water samples gathered by researchers were found to contain bacteria and fungi that are resistant to several drugs. These microorganisms, referred to as MDR pathogens, are also referred to as “superbugs.” Further testing on 16 of those samples showed that 13 samples contained antibiotic and antifungal drugs.

The study also noted that thousands of tons of waste from pharmaceutical manufacturing are produced by the factories every day.

While this study examined the implications of drug manufacturing in one of India’s top producing cities, the study cautioned that “microbes’ ability to travel within human hosts and traded animals or goods means that multidrug resistance can move around the world within a flight time of only a few hours.” Also highlighted in the study’s discussion is the issue of “relaxed” regulation of pollution:

“Despite decades of campaigning by local NGOs and legal action taken to the highest Indian courts, the pollution of the surroundings of manufacturing plants has not been reduced. In fact, regulation targeting the pharmaceutical industry is actually becoming more relaxed as the government lifts restrictions on plant expansion and introduces changes to the national pollution index. This index, which has been in place since 2009, has repeatedly classified the Patancheru–Bollaram industrial area as ‘critically polluted’. The government recently removed certain criteria relating to health and the environment from the index in the name of simplification, despite heavy criticism by the media that these changes were made to benefit polluting industries.”

The study concluded by advising more rigid regulations in the drug manufacturing process to align with environmental laws.

According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, drug companies are required to adhere to guidelines known as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), but that anti-pollution measures are absent from those guidelines.

“Even the World Health Organisation (WHO) – a global public health body which has repeatedly called for concerted international action to tackle the dangerous threat of antibiotic resistance – buys antibiotics from companies whose drug ingredients are made in Hyderabad without carrying out environmental checks,” noted the Bureau."

Associated Press is reporting that NASA is to release luminescent, artificial clouds above the mid-atlantic coast.

The clouds will be accompanied by a sounding rocket launch from the Wallops Flight Facility on Virginia’s eastern shore between 4:25 a.m. and 4:42 a.m.

NASA’s stated purpose of the release is to test a new system to support studies of the ionosphere.

NASA is to launch a sounding rocket and deploy the 10 canisters into the air about 6-12 miles from the rocket.

The canisters will “deploy blue-green and red vapor forming artificial clouds, which will allow scientists on the ground to track particle motions,” AP reports.

The report came out on Tuesday, May 30 and stated that the test would take place on Tuesday – so it is unclear to this writer whether the clouds have already been released or if they are for the following Tuesday. That’s all we know for now.

As we’ve said with the release of re-engineered mosquitoes and Zika spraying hysteria – isn’t it nice when we get told what is going to happen instead of being petitioned what experiments our public funds are used for?

Now that you know about the test, one can at least track the results of NASA’s ionosphere tests, hopefully in the near future.

"News reports on the recent death of dictator Manuel Noriega have largely ignored the U.S.’ invasion of his country after he ceased to be “useful.” The 1989 invasion resulted in countless civilian deaths and helped cement the U.S.’ reputation as an oppressive force in Latin America.

Manuel Antonio Noriega waves to supporters, in the presidential palace in Panama City. Noriega, a onetime U.S. asset who later was ousted by an American invasion in 1989, died late Monday, May 29, 2017, at age 83. (AP/John Hopper)

CHILE– Former dictator of Panama Manuel Noriega died on Monday, prompting media outlets throughout the Americas and elsewhere to reflect on his legacy – a legacy dominated by the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama that was intended to end his rule. Noriega, who was well-known for his ties to the CIA, was removed from power in what was then the largest American military action to take place since Vietnam due to his connections to drug trafficking and brutality.

While there is no denying that Noriega was a dictator, media reports on his death have largely failed to acknowledge the real motives behind the fall of grace of a man who was a long-time CIA asset, receiving $100,000 from the intelligence agency annually for his “help.” Indeed, both of the crimes that allegedly led the U.S. to remove Noriega – drug-running, and brutality – were committed with the full knowledge – and likely the assistance – of the CIA.

The U.S. justification for the invasion of Panama cited Noriega’s drug-running operation in tandem with infamous narcotraficante Pablo Escobar, who in recent years was also revealed to be a CIA asset. Indeed, the 2007 crash of a CIA plane in Mexico bound to the U.S. – filled with 4 tons of cocaine – suggests that this is a habit the agency never intended to kick – and still hadn’t when the U.S. invaded Panama in 1989.

In addition, Noriega’s brutality was already considered problematic by U.S. authorities at the time. Noriega, who had political opponents butchered and regularly sent violent supporters into the streets to intimidate the opposition, did so with the full knowledge of the U.S., which sought to keep him in power as long as he remained useful.

During Noriega’s time in power, the U.S. backed numerous military dictatorships throughout Latin America, such as the brutal regime of Augusto Pinochet in Chile, and none of these leaders were subjected to the unilateral invasion and coup that targeted Noriega. Clearly, “brutality” was not the motive.

Noriega’s true crime could be found in his attempts to act independently from the U.S., along with the fact that he – perhaps naively – tried to play both sides of the struggle between the U.S. and Latin American leftists. Noriega’s fate was most likely sealed, however, when he displayed minimal enthusiasm about aiding the CIA and their Contra army in waging a hellish war against Nicaraguan civilians.

“Overwhelming force” directed at innocent citizens of Panama

But more troubling than the U.S.’ real reasons for taking out Noriega was the invasion itself. Nearly 27,000 U.S. troops were sent to Panama to hunt for a single man. However, the massive deployment was indicative of the Colin Powell doctrine of “overwhelming force” that would make itself known in the years to follow.

While U.S. media justified the intervention as necessary due to Noriega’s abuses of human rights, the invasion itself violated human rights on a massive scale and left scores of innocents dead. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that civilians, particularly those living in the El Chorillo neighborhood of Panama City, where Noriega was born, were intentionally targeted by the U.S. military in order to terrify them into submission.

Three hours before U.S. forces razed El Chorillo to the ground, American officials had been informed by a European diplomat about Noriega’s exact location. While the diplomat had been “100-percent certain” of the dictator’s whereabouts, he stated that “when I called, SouthCom [the U.S. southern military command] said it had other priorities.”

What followed was the near-complete destruction of one of Panama City’s poorest neighborhoods. According to anonymous witnesses, whose testimonies were recounted in the award-winning documentary The Panama Deception, “The North Americans began burning down El Chorillo at about 6:30 in the morning. They would throw a small device into a house and it would catch on fire. They would burn a house, and then move to another and begin the process all over again. They burned from one street to the next. They coordinated the burning through walkie-talkies.”

Aside from the mass burnings of homes, innocent civilians were crushed by tanks and executed in the street by U.S. forces, who later piled the corpses together and burned them. Survivors were allegedly hired to fill mass graves and were paid $6 per corpse. To top it all off, U.S. forces also indiscriminately bombed El Chorillo.

The Central American Human Rights Commission (COEDHUCA) estimates that between 2,000 and 3,000 Panamanians were killed in the invasion, likely a conservative estimate.

The U.S. invasion of Panama is indicative of how the U.S. has treated Latin America for much of the past century. According to historian John Coatsworth, the U.S. overthrew 41 governments in Latin America between 1989 and 1994, many of which were targeted in order to teach Latin Americans “to elect good men,” as Woodrow Wilson had once put it. However, the invasion of Panama also paved the way for later U.S. military intervention.

Conducted unilaterally and internationally condemned, the invasion of Panama sent a clear message that the U.S. military was free to do as it pleased, unbound by ethics or laws. Not only that, but the invasion marked the first time that the restoration of “democracy” had been used as a justification for “humanitarian-based” unilateral action, making the U.S.’ imposition of its definition of democracy on other nations more important than the precept of national sovereignty."

CHANTILLY, 31 MAY 2017

The 65th Bilderberg Meeting will take place from 1-4 June 2017 in Chantilly, Virginia, USA. As of today, 131 participants from 21 countries have confirmed their attendance. As ever, a diverse group of political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media has been invited. The list of participants is available here.

The key topics for discussion this year include:

The Trump Administration: A progress report Trans-Atlantic relations: options and scenarios The Trans-Atlantic defence alliance: bullets, bytes and bucks The direction of the EU Can globalisation be slowed down? Jobs, income and unrealised expectations The war on information Why is populism growing? Russia in the international order The Near East Nuclear proliferation China Current events

Founded in 1954, the Bilderberg Meeting is an annual conference designed to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. Every year, between 120-140 political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media are invited to take part in the conference. About two thirds of the participants come from Europe and the rest from North America; approximately a quarter from politics and government and the rest from other fields.

The conference is a forum for informal discussions about major issues facing the world. The meetings are held under the Chatham House Rule, which states that participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s) nor any other participant may be revealed.

Thanks to the private nature of the meeting, the participants are not bound by the conventions of their office or by pre-agreed positions. As such, they can take time to listen, reflect and gather insights. There is no desired outcome, no minutes are taken and no report is written. Furthermore, no resolutions are proposed, no votes are taken, and no policy statements are issued.

"Ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage has laughed off reports by the Guardian that he is a “person of interest” in an FBI investigation into alleged collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign as “fake news.”

According to the newspaper, the former UKIP leader and MEP has attracted the interest of US investigators because of his relationship with individuals connected to both the Trump campaign and Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, which published troves of hacked emails that damaged Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

Russia has adamantly denied all allegations of collusion in the US election.

“In response to the Guardian article, it has taken me a long time to finish reading because I am laughing so much,” Farage says.

“The hysterical attempt to associate me with the Putin regime is a result of the liberal elite being unable to accept Brexit and the election of President Trump.

“For the record, I have never been to Russia, I’ve had no business dealings with Russia in my previous life and I have appeared approximately three times on RT in the last 18 months.

“I consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the FBI as I have no connections to Russia.

“My meeting with Julian Assange was organized for me by LBC Radio with a view to conducting an interview.”

He added: “This is fake news.”

In response to the Guardian article, it has taken me a long time to finish reading because I am laughing so much at this fake news. — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) June 1, 2017 I consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the FBI as I have no connections to Russia. — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) June 1, 2017

The Guardian’s sources say Farage is a person of interest because of his proximity to people at the heart of their investigation. Farage has not been accused of any wrongdoing but the FBI thinks he has information about the acts under investigation, the newspaper reports.

“One of the things the intelligence investigators have been looking at is points of contact and persons involved,” a source said.

“If you triangulate Russia, WikiLeaks, Assange and Trump associates the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage. He’s right in the middle of these relationships. He turns up over and over again. There’s a lot of attention being paid to him.”

Farage was the first British politician to meet Trump following his election victory, and they had their picture taken together in front of a golden elevator in Trump Tower. The pair met again in February, where they had dinner with Trump’s daughter and advisor, Ivanka, and her husband and White House advisor, Jared Kushner.

It was a great honour to spend time with @realDonaldTrump. He was relaxed and full of good ideas. I'm confident he will be a good President. pic.twitter.com/kx8cGRHYPQ — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) November 12, 2016

In November, Trump suggested Farage should become the British ambassador to the US.

Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016

CIA director John Brennan has claimed WikiLeaks worked with Russia via third parties. Assange has denied these claims.

Brennan has also claimed Russia “brazenly interfered” in the 2016 US presidential election, however, he admitted to a House Select Committee on intelligence last week that he had there were “unresolved questions” as to whether any Trump campaign officials actually colluded with Russia."
"Many of the world's most powerful people are gathering for the annual meeting of the mysterious Bilderberg Group this week. Russia, the Trump administration and ‘The war on information’ are among key topics up for discussion.

This year’s gathering takes place in Chantilly, Virginia, less than 30 miles from the White House, and goings on in the Oval Office are top of the agenda for the 131 people who’ve confirmed they’re attending.

Many top White House figures will be at the four-day event, including the Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, National Security Advisor HR McMaster and Assistant to the President Christopher Liddell.

Other topics up for discussion include ‘Russia in the international order,’ China, ‘The Trans-Atlantic defence alliance: bullets, bytes and bucks,’ ‘The war on information,’ 'Direction of the EU’ and ‘Why is populism growing?’

This year’s event marks the 65th meeting of the infamously-secretive group which has met every year since 1954. Denis Healey, Joseph Retinger, David Rockefeller and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands were the group’s founders.

The group says the conference is “designed to foster dialogue between Europe and North America.” Each year it’s attended by people from the fields of politics, industry, finance, media and academia. About two thirds of the participants come from Europe and the rest from North America.

As well of some of Trump’s top brass, other attendees this year include Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, Republican senators Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham, and Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai.

Editors, and chief commentators, from several world famous publications including Bloomberg, The Economist, The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera and the London Evening Standard will also be in attendance.

Notorious for the lack of information about what happens during the discussions, meetings are closed to the public and to reporting journalists. All of the the meetings are held under the Chatham House Rule, which means that participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speakers can be revealed. Also, no minutes are taken and no report is written.

Damn, I really wanted to get in pic.twitter.com/K1ZAGEzmnW — Alex Rubinstein (@RealAlexRubi) May 26, 2017

Nobody can buy their way into the meetings, rather they have to be invited. The invited guests are not allowed to bring their partners and the group reportedly never visits the same hotel twice.

Among the most famous past attendees are Henry Kissinger (who is going again this year), Bill Gates, numerous members of European royal families, Bill Clinton, and Margaret Thatcher, who both attended before they rose to power."
"An independent group investigating the July 2016 murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich is suing the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser for information connected to the murder investigation.

The Profiling Project filed the lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court Wednesday morning, asserting that MPD has mismanaged the murder investigation. The group said that MPD’s stonewalling is unjustified.

“The release of this crucial material will help bring peace to the victim’s family, and it will help to either confirm or refute the various theories that swirl about this important murder case,” Washington, D.C. lobbyist and attorney Jack Burkman, who is leading The Profiling Project, asserted in court documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF).

ABC7 News asked MPD Chief Peter Newsham about the lawsuit, and posted the following response to Twitter.

@SweeneyABC just asked Chief Peter Newsham about lawsuit filed against @DCPoliceDept 2 hand over records of #SethRich murder case. @ABC7News pic.twitter.com/UzOeLFHQVq — Scott Taylor ABC 7 (@ScottTaylorTV) May 31, 2017

The complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief requests the disclosure of three specific pieces of information in the case; surveillance video footage from a nearby second-floor camera, the Medical Examiner’s report, and the forensic ballistic report.

Rich, 27, was the voter expansion data director at the DNC, according to Roll Call, and had been employed for two years. Rich also worked on a computer application to help voters locate polling stations, and had just accepted a job with Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign."
"There’s lots going down in Venezuela right now. Namely mass starvation and government shootings. You’d think these things newsworthy, but leftist media disagrees. Liberal networks avoid the word Venezuela like fat pride activists avoid vegetables. Take a look at this study…

Just this year alone, more than 50 people have been killed protesting Venezuela’s socialist dictatorship. According to the IMF, inflation will surpass 700% this year, while unemployment will hit 25%. Yet the Big Three evening newscasts have tried to pretend this crisis does not exist, offering virtually no coverage.

A new study by Media Research Center found that from March 2013 through May 29, 2017, the ABC, CBS and NBC evening news shows have aired a mere 25 stories, totaling 28 minutes, 39 seconds of coverage – barely 30 seconds per month – to the rapidly worsening situation in Venezuela. In this same time period, approximately 50,000 individual news stories on other topics aired on these broadcasts. The networks have also been reluctant to attach the “socialist” label to Venezuela’s government.

In case you need a quick refresher, here be the happenings in Venezuela…

Suffice it to say, there’s lots to cover. Venezuela is undergoing a tragic lesson the rest of the globe should study. Mainly: socialism is not a bastion of freedom, hope, dreams, or free ice cream. Socialism is the dystopia first world Tweens read about for fun. Except no network is volunteering as tribute here.

Leftist networks would rather spend their air time offering viewers 24/7/365 coverage of Donald Trump tweets and Russia conspiracies. “Stories” that further a liberal narrative take priority over stories that make liberal socialism look sh1tty. Conflict of interests being what they are."
"Middle East (SCF) – The recent NATO summit took a decision to formally become a member of the US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State (IS), in addition to its training mission in Iraq.

Last year, NATO started a training and capacity-building mission for Iraqi armed forces. In January, it opened a regional center in Kuwait. NATO AWACS aircraft operate in Syria. But the participation in combat actions against the IS has so far been limited to a few aircraft taking part in the operations of the US-led coalition of the willing. Formally, each alliance member contributes to the coalition, but NATO as its own entity does not. Despite the coalition’s efforts, the IS had grown and expanded in Syria till Russia launched its military operation there in 2015.

France and Germany have always had reservations about the prospect of joining the anti-IS coalition as an alliance, concerned that it would lead to NATO taking over the fight or overshadowing regional partners, such as Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Italy has been skeptical of the plan.

Despite all the speeches ringing alarm bells about the deadly threat coming from the IS – the mortal enemy of the West that vowed to fight it till it exists – the bloc’s combat ready forces are deploying…against Russia in the Eastern Europe! As a result, the alliance has seen no need to counter the IS plans to create a caliphate. It stubbornly turns a blind eye on the peril coming from the South.

Migrant flows are flooding the territories of European alliance members, terrorist acts are committed to kill citizens of the NATO member states, US and Turkish military are fighting the extremists on the ground but the bloc largely limits itself to words of condemnation while demonizing Russia – the country which says it does not want to provoke confrontation and calls for a dialogue!

The summit’s decision to join the fight comes at a time the US, UK and France-backed rebel forces based in Jordan are reported to be preparing for operations on Syrian soil. On May 18, US aircraft struck a convoy of forces affiliated with the Syrian government. The attack occurred in far southern Syria near al-Tanf, along the Syria-Iraq border – an area where US Special Operations Forces (SOF) are training local fighters. The leading NATO member plunged directly into the Syrian conflict taking sides. Evidently, the move signaled broadening of American involvement in the six-year Syrian civil war. The US has led the anti-IS in Syria since 2014, but so far has avoided engaging with Syrian government or Iran-backed forces.

The US, the UK and France are the leading members of the alliance and there is little doubt they are preparing to cross the border and establish control over the region where the borders of Jordan, Syria, and Iraq meet. They will need support of other nations, especially the allied ones and it coincides with NATO’s decision to become part of the anti-IS operation. The control over the area by NATO-supported forces will include a key highway from Baghdad to Damascus that Iran has used to supply weapons to Syrian forces. Al-Tanf is a strategic crossing located at the intersection of the Jordanian, Iraq, and Syrian borders and commands the No.1 Route linking Baghdad with Damascus and the Jordanian capital of Amman.

It all happens at a time NATO members involved in the combat actions and Israel are deeply concerned over the recent visit of a high-ranking Iraqi military to Damascus to discuss the situation on the Syrian-Iraqi border. The allegation that Iraq’s Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi has pivoted his support away from the US-led campaign to the Russia-Turkey-Iran coalition adds even more fuel to the fire.

Definitely, the contribution will increase. Right after the summit on May 25, the Netherlands announced the decision to send two more warplanes to fight the IS. From mid-June a Dutch KDC-10 tanker aircraft will be stationed in Kuwait. And in the last quarter of the year, a C-130 transport plane will be contributed to the fight for two months. About 90 military personnel will go with the planes. The new deployment will temporarily increase the number of Dutch soldiers in Iraq to about 175, twenty more than previously agreed. The Dutch commandos currently supporting Iraqi troops on the front will be equipped with armored vehicles and other weapons systems from next month. The Netherlands also expressed readiness to contribute several F-16 fighters from early next year. Other NATO members will increase the contribution to support the NATO effort. It will increase but it is worth to remember that the bloc’s operations in Libya and Afghanistan ended up in failure.

Expanding NATO role in Syria may lead to either confrontation or coordination, or at least de-confliction, with the Russia-Syria-Iran forces. Turkey, a NATO country, is a member of Russia-Turkey-Iran trio pushing forward the Astana peace process. And the common enemy is the IS. Coordination of efforts appears to be a logical step. The issue should top the NATO-Russia Council agenda along with the plans to establish de-escalation zones. It could be discussed with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the G20 summit.

Some arrangement with Russia is unavoidable. But is it an achievable goal with NATO building up its forces in the Baltics, Poland, Romania and the whole Black Sea region? Can Russia and NATO fruitfully coordinate efforts, or even cooperate, in Syria with tensions running high in Europe? Evidently, the standoff between Russia and NATO benefits no one but IS. Finding mutual understanding is indispensable to defeat the common enemy. Actually, playing off the West against Russia is the IS only hope for survival. That’s the expectation the group must be deprived of. It remains to be seen if these arguments are taken into consideration as NATO joins the fray."
"Commenting on the current state of the European experiment, George Soros warned the European Union has plunged it into an existential crisis as a result of ""dysfunctional"" institutions and austerity mandates, and will require the bloc to reinvent itself to survive. Speaking at the Brussels Economic Forum, the billionaire investor said the EU had ""lost its momentum"" as he urged policymakers to abandon hopes of ""ever closer union"" driven by a top-down approach from Brussels, a statement which will likely displease Germany.

""The European Union is now in an existential crisis,"" Soros told a Brussels audience. ""Most Europeans of my generation were supporters of further integration. Subsequent generations came to regard the EU as an enemy that deprives them of a secure and promising future.""

Just a day after Brussels published a paper mapping out its vision of eurozone integration, Mr Soros warned that the single currency area had become ""the exact opposite of what was originally intended"" according to the Telegraph.

Quoted by CNBC, Soros said Europe's ""reinvention would have to revive the support that the European Union used to enjoy."" The reinvention would have to review past mistakes and explain what went wrong, and make proposals to make things right.

Soros welcomed a German idea to cut European funds aimed at reducing income inequalities at the regional level for those countries disrespecting the rule of law. Both Hungary and Poland, which are net recipients of the so-called cohesion funds, have been criticized by European institution for their weak standards with regards to the rule of law.

The billionaire also reminded his hosts that ""the European Union was meant to be a voluntary association of like-minded states that were willing to surrender part of their sovereignty for the common good. After the financial crisis of 2008, the eurozone was transformed into a creditor/debtor relationship where the debtor countries couldn’t meet their obligations and the creditor countries dictated the terms that the debtors had to meet.""

""By imposing an austerity policy they made it practically impossible for the debtor countries to grow out of their debts. The net result was neither voluntary nor equal.""

He, correctly, said loss of trust in the EU has paved the way for support for anti-European political parties and said the goal of ""an ever closer union"" had to be abandoned.

""Now we need a collaborative effort that combines the top-down approach of the EU institutions with the bottom-up movements that are necessary to engage the electorate,"" said Soros and added that ""instead of a “multi-speed” Europe we should aim for a “multi-track” Europe that would allow member states a wider variety of choices. This would have a far-reaching beneficial effect.""

He urged the bloc to focus on three key areas - dealing with the refugee crisis, Brexit and ""the lack of an economic growth strategy"".

Fight Xenophobia and Hostile Powers

Predictably, the man who some have alleged was behind the great migration movement that sent 1 million mostly Syrian refugees in Germany in the past 2 years, Soros said Europe needs to overcome the current ""existential crisis"" by fighting together against the rise of anti-European sentiment, xenophobic feelings and surrounding ""hostile powers.""

“Externally the EU is now surrounded by hostile powers: Putin’s Russia, Erdogan’s Turkey, Sisi’s Egypt and the America that Trump would like to create but can’t,” Soros said.

He called for an update of European treaties to make the EU work better and allow a ""multitrack"" bloc where countries would have a wider variety of choices when it comes to integration.

Brexit

Discussing Brexit, Soros - who rose to prominence as the man who broke the Bank of England for his bets against the pound in the early 1990s - warned Brussels against punishing Britain in forthcoming Brexit negotiations and said Brussels should not get distracted with the upcoming EU exit negotiations with the U.K. and continue their work to regain the trust of EU citizens.

""Brexit will be an immensely damaging process, harmful to both sides. Most of the damage is felt right now, when the European Union is in an existential crisis, but its attention is diverted to negotiating the separation from Britain,"" he said.

He also said Brexit is likely to take ""as long as five years"" and that the EU should approach negotiations in a ""constructive spirit"" and should use Brexit ""to transform itself into an organization that other countries like Britain would want to join"", instead of seeking to punish Britain.

""The European Union must resist temptation to punish Britain and approach the negotiations in a constructive spirit. It should use Brexit as a catalyst for introducing far-reaching reforms,"" Soros said. ""The divorce will be a long process taking a long as five years... During that time the EU could transform itself into an organization that other countries like Britain would want to join. If that happens the two sides will want to be reunited even before the divorce is completed."""
"News that Goldman purchased some $2.8 billion in Venezuela bonds issued by state oil company PDVSA and until recently held by Venezuela's central bank - at a 30% discount to market, paying 31 cents on the dollar or around $865 million in notional - quickly set off a firestorm of angry protests, in which Goldman was accused of making money from other people's misery (even though the story of Goldman's involvement in Venezuela's debt is hardly new, as we reported in 2014 in ""How Goldman Sachs Became Broke Venezuela's Loan Shark""

Naturally, Goldman defended the investment, with Goldman Sachs Asset Management saying it had bought the securities from a broker and did not interact with the Venezuelan government. They will be held in funds and accounts managed on behalf of its clients.

“We recognize that the situation is complex and evolving and that Venezuela is in crisis,” it said in a statement. “We agree that life there has to get better, and we made the investment in part because we believe it will.”

The explanation did little to appease demonstrators who, according to the FT, protested outside the US bank’s headquarters in Manhattan as they attacked its purchase of securities, at a time when other foreign companies have largely stopped investing in the quasi-civil war ridden country. To fund bond repayments, Venezuela has been raiding its foreign reserves, which have dropped from $30 billion before Maduro was elected four years ago to about $10 billion; recently Venezuela's opposition beckoned Wall Street to beware Maduro's attempts to liquidate the country's gold reserves as it tries to procure much needed liquidity.

The demonstrators outside the bank’s New York headquarters Tuesday chanted, “No more hunger bonds, Goldman Sachs,” and the term was flying around the internet, appearing in scores of tweets and memes that featured images of malnourished Venezuelans scavenging for food, Bloomberg reported.

But will the attempt to shame Goldman succeed?

As Bloomberg correctly notes, ""growing publicity doesn’t necessarily translate into greater success in implementing the boycott, and it isn’t entirely clear what it would achieve anyway, but Jorge Botti, a Venezuelan businessman who started the movement last year, is thrilled.""

“I’ve had friends tell me I’m an idiot for talking about this, that capital has never had a heart and that’s why it works so well, but I think that world could find another way of functioning,” Botti said in an interview. “I think it’s going to start resonating a bit more.”

Botti was the first to use the term ""Hunger Bonds"" in October 2016 in a post to his 17,000 Twitter followers as part of his effort to raise awareness about suffering in the country. A former bondholder himself, he decided in 2015 that he couldn’t justify accepting the payments and sold his stake. “The bondholders know that they’re being paid at the expense of the country’s hunger,” said Botti, who runs a business importing hardware. “A lot of people tell me that the bonds don’t have anything to do with people, but I tell them it’s a moral issue.”

Harvard University professor Ricardo Hausmann, who gave the “hunger bonds” phrase a boost when he used it in an essay last week, argued that ethics can’t be ignored anymore.

Holding the bonds, most of which trade for about 50 cents on the dollar, risks incentivizing investors to root for payments to be made even as the populace suffers, he says. If there’s a default, bondholders will be agitating for the right to seize Venezuelan assets for payment -- assets that should belong to the Venezuelan people.

As we reported yesterday, Venezuela’s opposition parties also immediately criticized Goldman, with Julio Borges, president of the National Assembly, saying lawmakers will begin an investigation and evaluate whether “a future, democratic government of Venezuela should recognize or pay on this debt entered into against the interests of our people.”

Hausmann said Goldman bought the bonds at such a discount that it can expect a yield of 48 per cent.

""These are hunger bonds,” Mr Hausmann said. “Goldman Sachs has issued a set of principles regarding human rights that they commit to abide by. They violated their own commitments.”

Others, such as Francisco Ghersi, disagreed with the protesters' strategy. The managing director of the Venezuelan-dedicated hedge fund Knossos Asset Management said the shaming effort is misguided. Venezuela’s problems are caused by corruption and economic mismanagement, not the debt itself, he says. “What’s happening now is a tragedy, but it’s not the product of two years of paying off bonds,” Ghersi said. “It’s audacious to say that today people are dying of hunger because of the foreign debt.”

They may not be dying because of the debt, but they are certainly not being prioritzed above bondholders in Maduro's ""priority"" waterfall. As such, every payment made to creditors, is a few millions dollars less than can be used to the immediate needs of the population, especially since Venezuela's default is only a matter of time.

Botti says investors trying to guess exactly how long Venezuela will be able to keep making debt payments are being myopic. He wants the world focused on the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, not the outsize returns on its bonds. “Among my fellow entrepreneurs and economists, there is no reflection on the subject,” he said. “But I think we must insist.”

Also, it is worth noting it wasn't just Goldman. Earlier today, WSJ reported that ""Nomura Securities bought about $100 million worth of Venezuelan government bonds last week as part of the same transaction that has landed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in the thick of a political controversy.""

Nomura’s trading arm paid about $30 million for the debt, a steep discount to where the troubled country’s bonds trade in the market, according to people familiar with the matter. Those are roughly the same terms on which Goldman’s asset-management arm bought $2.8 billion worth of the same bonds in a transaction brokered by an intermediary, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. Nomura was approached by the same intermediary, the London subsidiary of a small broker, Dinosaur Merchant Bank Ltd., some of the people said.

Of course, for the banks only one thing matters being profitable, the concerns of the protesters and the Venezuela population comes last, if at all. Then again, maybe this time is different: looking at the price of the PDVSA 6% bonds of 2022 today, shows that someone(s) was busy selling...

Did the blitz-mass media campaign actually succeed in ""shaming"" Goldman, forcing it to sell some - or all - of its ""Hunger Bond"" holdings (at a sizable profit)? If so, it would be the first time that social pressure has been a decisive factor in the bank's investing decisions, and could potentially unleash an overhaul in how ""hunger"" bonds issued by other ""questionable"" emerging market regimes are valued and funded."
"Russia is ready to sell its S-400 air defense systems to Turkey, President Vladimir Putin said at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF). He added the issue was discussed earlier with his Turkish counterpart.

“We discussed the possibility of selling S-400s [to Turkey]. We are ready for this,” Putin said in answer to a question from a Turkish media reporter.

Speaking about cooperation between Moscow and Ankara in assembling the defense systems in Turkey, he said it depends on the readiness of local manufacturing industry.

“At the moment, we don't produce those systems abroad,” Putin added.

“We are ready to deliver these newest and most efficient systems. President [Recep Tayip] Erdogan and our countries’ militaries are aware of it.”

Currently, Russia and India are jointly producing the Brahmos hypersonic missile, but such projects require massive investment in technologies and human resources, the president said. “But overall, there is nothing impossible.”

Previous media reports suggested that Moscow and Ankara had discussed the sale of S-400s in May, when Putin hosted Erdogan in Sochi. While Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said at that time the deal was “possible,” Turkish Defense Minister Fikri Isik said negotiations between Russia and Turkey were close to conclusion.

“Work on the S-400 has reached a final point. But the final stage does not mean ‘Let's sign a deal tomorrow morning,’” Isik said as cited by Reuters. The minister said that Ankara turned to Moscow for the system because “NATO member countries have not presented an offer which is financially effective.”

The Russian-made S-400 system is capable of shooting down aircraft at ranges of up to 400km and ballistic missiles at a range of 60km, as well as engaging 36 targets simultaneously, according to open sources."

"For people with severe allergies, having an EpiPen can mean the difference between life and death. Because there’s no generic alternative, EpiPen manufacturer Mylan just keeps jacking up the price and ripping off patients. They also seem to have ripped off the government. Today, a probe by the Department of Health and Human Services concluded that the company actually stiffed taxpayers for three times more than was previously believed.

Mylan, the drug company that makes EpiPen, has been overcharging Medicare and Medicaid for years.…

Back in October, Mylan agreed to pay the US government $465 million without admitting any wrongdoing. It was the end of a long saga that showed what a vile company Mylan is and it was quickly rewarded with a bounce in its stock price. Senator Chuck Grassley released the findings of the HHS report today and he’s indicating that the final price that Mylan will need to pay may not be settled yet. “Mylan and the Obama Administration reportedly were close to settling the overpayment for much less than $1.27 billion,” Grassley writes in the statement. “Taxpayers have a right to know what happened here and to be repaid whatever they are owed.”"
"A couple weeks ago, I wrote a post about Huma Abedin filing for divorce.

She had finally chopped off Anthony Weiner, or so the story went. This, despite the fact that reports had recently stated that the relationship was on the mend. Of course, the day she filed for divorce was also the day Weiner pled guilty to transferring obscene material to a minor, so maybe it was all about public perception. If so, perhaps she should have been smart enough to stay the fuck away from the guy. After all, the paparazzi has him and her staked out 24/7, 365.

As it turns out, she’s not that smart. Or maybe she has some kind of sickness herself?

Just when you thought Huma Abedin finally had enough, the Hillary Clinton aide has invited her admitted sex offender hubby back home again, The Post has learned. Anthony Weiner’s long-suffering wife filed for divorce earlier this month, the same day the disgraced ex-congressman pleaded guilty to sexting with a 15-year-old girl. But Abedin has since renewed the lease on their pricey Union Square duplex — and invited back home the man who has repeatedly heaped humiliation upon her, sources told The Post… The sext-crazed pol, who had been sleeping on his mother’s couch in Park Slope, was to move out Tuesday, a source said. “He was supposed to move,” the building source explained. “But they just signed for another year.” Another source said, “She still hasn’t served him with the divorce papers.” Weiner, who will have to register as a sex offender as part the plea deal with the Manhattan US Attorney’s Office, was spotted Tuesday at about 9 a.m. strolling out of the building with his and Abedin’s 5-year-old son. A pal of the couple said that Weiner has been the primary caretaker for the boy, especially while Abedin worked on Clinton’s failed presidential bid. “Huma is worried about her son,” the pal said. “That’s her priority, and Anthony plays a very strong role in raising him.”

Ah, it’s all about the child, you see! I think a lot of people might think it a bad idea to let this man have continued access to children, even those who are his own. He did take one of his crotch shots while his kid was laid up in the bed next to him. I can’t think of too many things more disrespectful to a marriage than that. At least keep you kid of of your extramarital activities. Then again, Weiner has no shame and appears to be mentally ill.

Which makes Huma’s choice all the more baffling. We all know Hillary Clinton’s prospects are in the dump, so it’s not like Ms. Abedin is likely to return to frontline politics anytime soon. But she definitely won’t be returning so long as the Weiner albatross is hanging around her neck. I think she might be just as deranged as he is. If he is indeed sick, let him get help, serve his time, and perhaps he could see the kid someday down the road. Way down the road. What kind of maniac let’s this disturbed individual continue to cohabitate with their child?

Never mind. I think I answered my own question.

WEINER KNOWS WHERE ALL THE BODIES ARE BURIED, AND HE'S TOO HIGH PROFILE FOR HILLARY TO #SethRich HIM. HE'S CALLING THE SHOTS. — CAPSLOCK HUSTLA (@CAPSLOCKHUSTLER) May 31, 2017"
"For decades the U.S. foreign policy elite and its presidents played the farce of an altruistic United States that acts for the global good and in the interest of humanity. That was always a lie. Wherever one takes a deeper look the U.S. acted solely in its (perceived) self interests. But the rhetoric helped to drag others along. Tributary governments could pretend they worked for the ""universal good"" when they in fact just followed orders from Washington DC. U.S. pressure was applied behind the curtain - through bribes, threats of revealing private secrets or, if necessary, via well managed ""democratic"" coups."

This converter works great, these guys put out stuff that's so simple to use, that you think, why does every other app seem so cluttered and complicated to do the same or less?"
"The recent NATO summit took a decision to formally become a member of the US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State (IS), in addition to its training mission in Iraq. Last year, NATO started a training and capacity-building mission for Iraqi armed forces. In January, it opened a regional center in Kuwait. NATO AWACS aircraft operate in Syria. But the participation in combat actions against the IS has so far been limited to a few aircraft taking part in the operations of the US-led coalition of the willing. Formally, each alliance member contributes to the coalition, but NATO as its own entity does not. Despite the coalition’s efforts, the IS had grown and expanded in Syria till Russia launched its military operation there in 2015."

"Berkey® Water Filtration and Purification Systems are the ultimate in water filtration and the ideal personal protection traveling companions. Used worldwide for normal, hostile and emergency environments to provide the purest, sparkling clean water possible…

For generations, health-conscious people around the world have recognized that the foundation to a healthy life and healthy body is clean, fresh drinking water. This important essential element is the basis for enjoying your longest, healthiest life. No amount of vitamins or supplements can substitute for the vital life-sustaining properties found in nourishing, healthful drinking water. It is truly the foundation of life.

The powerful Berkey Light purifies treated water and untreated raw water from such sources as remote lakes, streams, stagnant ponds and water supplies in foreign countries, where regulations may be sub-standard at best.

Perfect for everyday use and a must in hostile environments where electricity, water pressure or treated water may not be available.

The powerful Berkey Light is the most flexible water purifier available providing reliable, user friendly and economical water purification in any environment.

The Berkey Light is a true gravity fed “purifier”. Below is an explanation of the difference between “Purification” and “Pathogenic removal”:

To claim Pathogenic bacterial “removal” one must demonstrate: 99.99% reduction.

To claim “purification” one must demonstrate: 99.99999% reduction.

The Berkey Light has demonstrated: 99.9999999% reduction.

In fact, we tested the Berkey Light with the maximum pathogenic contamination levels that can be produced in a laboratory. When contamination levels exceed one billion pathogens per liter of water (10,000 times the density of contamination used in the standard test protocol for bacteriological removal) they become too numerous to count(TNTC). Such contamination levels are referred to as “lawn growth”. Under normal testing protocol; one pathogenic organism is tested at a time. However, we had the laboratory mix together a soup of three separate pathogenic lawn growth cultures. We then tested the system under this extreme contamination level and absolutely no pathogens were able to make it through the purification elements. We then had the laboratory incubate the water and nothing grew. We then had them view the effluent under an electron microscope and not even in-viable(dead) microbes were detectable. Nothing was present but pure H2O. You can print a copy of this test report by clicking on the Print Brochures button to the left and click on the “Black Berkey® LSU Report”.

The revolutionary Berkey Light’s self-sterilizing and re-cleanable filters purify water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites entirely and by extracting harmful chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, VOCs, organic solvents, radon 222 and trihalomethanes. They also reduce nitrates, nitrites, and unhealthy minerals such as lead and mercury. In fact, this purifier is so powerful, it can remove food coloring from water without removing the beneficial minerals that your body needs, which, to our knowledge, no other domestic filtration system can duplicate.

Easy Setup and Simple Installation:

The Berkey Light system sets up in minutes. Simply screw in the purification elements and spigot, snap the chambers and base together and you are ready to purify your water. The Berkey Light is so powerful it can be used to filter non-potable or unhealthy water in situations where electricity and water pressure are not available. For normal everyday situations or for hostile filtration environments, the Berkey Light is the most flexible and adaptable water filter available. The Berkey Light provides reliable, user friendly, powerful and economical water filtration and enhances the ambience of any environment.

How the Berkey Light Operates:

Berkey Light water purifiers are the most practical, user friendly and economical water purification systems available. To use, water is poured into the upper chamber. Gravity draws the water through the exclusive Black Berkey® purification elements. Contaminates are captured on and within the micro-porous purification elements and are separated from the water. The purified water then collects in the lower chamber where it can be drawn through the spigot. While in use, the system is joined together allowing the Berkey Light to be transported while it purifies water. This feature is useful when purified water is required in one location, such as in a food preparation area, and later in another location such as a dining area. There is no guesswork when refilling the system because the water level, in both chambers, is visible at all times. The elevated base raises the spigot level, allowing the Berkey Light to be utilized anywhere on a flat surface

The shatter resistant and virtually unbreakable Berkey Light is made of a Non-BPA Co-polyester. The Berkey Light does not leach foul tasting plasticizers into your water and will not retain foul tastes and odors from waterborne contaminants.

The Berkey Light is so powerful it can be used to purify non-potable or unhealthy water in situations where electricity and water pressure are not available. For normal everyday situations or for hostile filtration environments, the Berkey Light is the most flexible and adaptable water filter available. The Berkey Light provides reliable, user friendly, powerful and economical water filtration and enhances the ambience of any environment."

"Last December, after becoming executive editor of BNR and CEO of its parent company True Blue Media, I began the process of getting to know this amazing community of one million+ people.

Over the past eight months, the BNR team has produced some of the most widely shared political content of any media publication in the U.S, from news articles and personal essays to investigative reports, videos and graphics.

This piece on Hillary Clinton’s ethics is the most popular article about Hillary of the entire campaign, with more than half a million shares and counting.

on Hillary Clinton’s ethics is the most popular article about Hillary of the entire campaign, with more than half a million shares and counting. Our video from the Republican National Convention has nearly ten million views on Facebook and is among the most watched summaries of the GOP convention.

and is among the most watched summaries of the GOP convention. We’ve created several top national hashtags, including #PresidentObamaNotBarry and #TrumpSpeechIn4Words.

We were the first to call Trump’s full pivot to white nationalism, which we did several days before he hired Breitbart’s Stephen Bannon.

On issue after issue, BNR has challenged conventional wisdom, questioned longstanding false frames, cut through traditional media talking points and provided actionable analysis of this unpredictable election cycle.

And every step of the way, our dedicated community has provided essential feedback, spread the word, and helped shape the national conversation. We’re exceptionally proud of the work we’ve done together.

Now comes the next phase in True Blue Media’s goal to build the premiere media platform for people who share Blue America’s worldview.

In September, we are launching Shareblue, our flagship site. Our Facebook community is now Shareblue and our Twitter account is @shareblue, which we invite you to follow.

In October, we plan to introduce a new polling and predictive modeling destination created by Anthony Reed of Benchmark Politics.

Meanwhile, all BNR’s content will remain on bluenationreview.com and all the articles you liked, tweeted and shared will be right where you first found them.

The high levels of engagement with BNR’s content shows there is a need for practical political content that challenges conventional narratives about the people and events shaping our world. With Shareblue, we intend to serve that need, applying the same rigorous editorial standards as we have with BNR, while further expanding our scope of coverage.

Thank you for your continued support!"
"Several independent studies have confirmed what is intuitively obvious, and frankly, staggering: Donald Trump receives more favorable national media coverage than Hillary Clinton. Just ask Mark Halperin, the quintessential media insider, who recently conceded: “There’s a deep well of anti-Clinton sentiment in the press.” The national media are stumped by Trump, seeking false “balance” (and clicks) out of deference to his voters. Yet somehow, that deference is absent in Hillary’s case; she and her voters are maligned and marginalized at every turn. This open letter proposes a solution to the imbalanced coverage.

To the National Media:

I write this letter as a concerned American, a father who fears for his children in the event of a Trump presidency. And I write it as the CEO of a political media company with a community of over one million people whose engagement rates rival the largest media platforms in the U.S.

On the one hand, I know most of you understand that Donald is a menace to America and that Hillary is the only plausible president in the race. On the other hand, I recognize these facts:

a) You’re chasing clicks and therefore you want a contest.

b) You face relentless (and ridiculous) accusations from the right that you have a “liberal bias.”

c) You feel compelled to appear even-handed in a misguided quest for “balanced” reporting.

d) The price of entry into the elite media club is open disdain for Hillary Clinton.

And so you twist yourselves into rhetorical pretzels trying to legitimize Trump’s unhinged behavior.

How else to explain this NY Times headline?

Now take a look at how it’s done with Hillary:

See, it shouldn’t be that hard to cover Donald in a way that feels fair. Simply apply the three immutable tenets of Hillary reporting:

Always assume bad character and attribute malicious motives. Completely overlook and invisibilize supporters. Focus relentlessly on negatives — and portray positives as negatives.

Now apply that same standard to Donald:

Always assume anything he says or does is corrupt. Start from the position that he’s malicious and manipulative, as you do with Hillary. Presume everything he does is part of a duplicitous scheme. Treat him like a grotesque caricature of a human being, an ambitious automaton, a power-hungry monster devoid of the most basic humanity. Attribute nefarious motives to anything he says, even the way he laughs or smiles. Pay no mind to his supporters. None whatsoever. Don’t worry about offending them. If you have the slightest pang of guilt, just keep in mind how you’ve continually dismissed Hillary’s 15.8 million voters with your demeaning “enthusiasm gap” narrative. Tell your audience only about the people who don’t like him, never those who do. In every interview, ask him why he’s so despised. Focus relentlessly on every negative data point to portray him as an isolated outcast, just as you do with Hillary. Roadblock every negative story, just like you’ve done with Hillary’s emails, which our research shows you’ve covered every single day for an entire year. Obsess, obsess, obsess. Endlessly obsess until your audience goes numb from the repetition, until a single word like “transcripts” or “emails” or “foundation” conjures oceans of opprobrium. Probe every permutation of his words and actions and fit them into damaging frames concocted by rival opposition researchers. Examine every nook and cranny of what you consider to be his rank awfulness, just as you do with Hillary.

I could go on, but you get the point.

DEAR MEDIA: You've spent a year hammering #Hillary for her emails. Now let's see how you cover #Trump calling for her assassination. — Peter Daou (@peterdaou) August 9, 2016

Here’s the bottom line: With Donald inviting the assassination of his opponent, calling President Obama the “founder of ISIS,” attacking a Gold Star family, calling on Russia to hack us, openly courting white nationalists, and displaying a total lack of preparedness for the office he seeks, you are facing an ethical dilemma. Do you continue treating Hillary with contempt or do you tell the truth about Trump?

The decisions you make, the decisions we each make in the next several weeks, will affect the fate of our country.

That’s not hyperbole.

Donald’s ghostwriter, Tony Schwartz — who knows him a lot better than you or I do — explains the stakes:

“I genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.”

You can’t just keep pretending that Donald and Hillary are equivalent. They’re not. Nor can you insist that their unfavorable ratings are remotely comparable. One candidate is a dedicated and admired public servant who is smeared and lied about simply for existing. The other is a bloviating bigot who lacks the most basic common decency. One candidate is trusted and respected by the most accomplished people in the world. The other is an intolerant and dangerous bully who is toxic to his own party and mocked across the globe.

Now here’s the staggering reality: You give Donald better coverage. Yes, you do. Look at this recent chart from Harvard’s Shorenstein Center.

Let that sink in. The candidate who wallows in bigotry, who incites violence, who verbally abuses his critics, who is a self-avowed threat to the free press, gets less negative coverage than his opponent, a lifelong public servant who is one of the most accomplished and admired women on the planet.

In return for your obsequious reporting, he bashes you with unconcealed glee:

I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2016

Actually, he first said reporters are ""the lowest form of life,"" but upgraded them instantly to ""the lowest form of humanity""

Moving on up! — Rebecca Sinderbrand (@sinderbrand) August 12, 2016

Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack – no longer a credible source — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2016

Just heard that crazy and very dumb @morningmika had a mental breakdown while talking about me on the low ratings @Morning_Joe. Joe a mess! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2016

It’s a toxic dynamic that only you have the power to change. He never will. Why would he?

If you’re worried that you’ll alienate your Republican audience by telling the truth about how ill-prepared Donald is for the presidency, my advice is simple: Be fair to him in the same way you’re “fair” to Hillary — namely, by doing your best to undermine his candidacy and damage his public image.

And if you think your ratings will suffer by covering both candidates equally, consider the fact that her millions of supporters will flock to anyone who has the guts to report on her without the usual cynicism. That’s not conjecture. As the author of the most shared article about Hillary of 2016 (half a million shares and counting), I know for a fact that unfiltered reporting on Hillary and her enthusiastic supporters is a path to success. There’s a hunger for fair coverage of Hillary.

Here’s what I mean by fair:

Don’t help peddle disgusting conspiracies about Hillary’s health as your peers Andrea Mitchell and Patrick Healy have done.

Don’t squander your credibility like the AP by publishing dishonest hit pieces on a foundation that saves children’s lives, drawing a false equivalence between Trump’s conspiracy-mongering and Hillary’s truth-telling, and writing puff pieces then scrubbing tweets about them.

Don’t follow in CNN’s footsteps by hiring former campaign managers who are still on the Trump campaign payroll.

Don’t indulge the kind of embarrassing headline writing employed by the Washington Post a day after Hillary delivered the speech of the campaign: “Clinton, Trump exchange racially charged accusations.” (No, WaPo, Trump falsely and disingenuously calling Hillary a “bigot” is not remotely the same as Hillary’s litany of Trump’s own words.)

I know it’s hard to let go of Beltway narratives, to defy the conventional media wisdom that Hillary must be attacked at all costs. I know you must struggle with your own conscience sometimes.

So I say this to you respectfully: Get your act together and start covering Donald the same way you cover Hillary — with dripping disdain, boundless skepticism and utter indifference to his voters.

Stop acting so mystified by his obnoxious behavior. Stop pondering if he magically lives outside the normal rules of politics. He doesn’t. He’s a frighteningly dangerous blowhard (and deep down, a coward) who knows you won’t cover him with the same contempt you reserve for Hillary. So far, he’s been right.

You have fewer than 80 days to show us your humanity, prove him wrong, and help save your country from a demagogue.

"Because of our do-nothing Republican Congress, popular wisdom assumes that the GOP has tied President Obama’s hands on the environment. But this couldn’t be further from the truth.

President Obama “goes big” and uses his executive authority to dramatically expand the size of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument off the coast of Hawaii, creating the largest protected place on the planet. This is just the latest and largest of President Obama’s extensive executive actions to protect the environment and combat climate change.

The GOP Congress has stalled, denied, and obstructed all Democratic efforts to address the disastrous consequences of climate change. And in Cleveland this summer, the GOP doubled down on attempts to reverse decades of bipartisan environmental protection.

Climate denial among Republicans has been astounding. Representative Joe Heck (R-NV), who is running to replace retiring Minority Leader Harry Reid, is a notorious climate change denier. Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) has had choice words for Americans who acknowledge the reality of climate change: “There’s an arrogance of power there that they’re utopians, that they really think they can create heaven on Earth, and where it’s failed in the past, those people like Stalin and Chavez and the Castros, the nut cases in North Korea.” (He has also claimed that it is “proven scientifically” that climate change isn’t real, because the temperature doesn’t seem any warmer to him.)

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida laughed off questions on the human-made impact of rising sea levels on his Miami constituents. He joked: “Well, sure, the climate is changing, and one of the reasons why the climate is changing is the climate has always been changing…as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there’s no such thing.”

This Republican denialism flies in the face of the 76 percent of Americans who agree with President Obama and Democrats. Clearly, the GOP leadership prefers to ignore the will of the American people, including 59 percent of Republican voters.

This Republican obstructionism has made it a herculean task for President Obama to make progress on climate change and environmental issues. So he has used his executive powers to the maximum possible extent. And he has been enormously effective.

Here are some examples:

Efficiency improvements at the Hoover Dam;

Cutting greenhouse gas emissions and expanding use of renewable energy at federal agencies;

Obtaining commitments from companies, agricultural producers, and other private-sector players to reduce carbon pollution and use clean energy through incentives, environmentally-sensitive requirements on beneficiaries of federal funds, as well as voluntary partnerships;

Rules to move federally-funded construction away from flood zones;

Significant expansion and designation of new national monuments like Papahānaumokuākea, which efforts have not only protected large swaths of our land, seas and eco-systems, but also prevent climate change because vegetation mitigates against rising carbon levels;

The Better Business Challenge and other initiatives, through which President Obama has spurred states, localities, businesses, utilities, factories, schools, universities, landlords, and homeowners to significantly improve energy efficiency;

Incentivizing private sector investments in green technologies;

Encouraging the expansion of energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements in low-income and affordable housing.

And this list is hardly exhaustive.

President Obama is the embodiment of the old adage, “where there’s a will, there’s a way.” He has deployed innovative and effective management and used his executive powers judiciously to help protect our planet.

"My colleague Peter Daou made an excellent argument that Donald Trump can take or leave the presidency…his real endgame is to mainstream white nationalism. It’s an intriguing possibility and it goes a long way to explaining why Trump is polling at literally zero percent with Black voters in key states, and why there has been a surge in minority voters registering as Democrats. And it certainly makes sense of his continued, desperate efforts to deny minority voters the franchise.

Donald Trump is now doubling down on a claim he made a week ago that the election might be “rigged,” and is now taking it one step further: He is asking people to volunteer to be “Trump Election Observers” who would stand guard at polling places and make sure Hillary supporters don’t “cheat.” He’s even put up a page on his website urging his supporters to take action:

The idea isn’t new. “Election observers” have actually been used for years by right-wing politicians. Under the guise of protecting the integrity of the polls, Republicans have sent vigilantes into Black and Latinx neighborhoods to intimidate minority voters and lower turnout.

Back in 1981, the New Jersey Republican Party sent people calling themselves the “National Ballot Security Task Force” to breathe down the necks of voters in minority neighborhoods — which may have enabled Republican Tom Kean to squeak to a 2,000-vote victory in the extremely close governor’s race.

This practice is illegal — in fact, just after Kean’s victory, the Republican National Committee was placed under a federal court order forbidding them from engaging in “ballot security” activities.

Trump may well be violating the Third Circuit’s consent decree — which is still in force — but vigilante poll watchers may be the only tactic he and the Republican Party have left to suppress minority votes.

Just last month, a federal court struck down North Carolina’s GOP-sponsored voting restrictions, saying that the law targeted Black voters “with almost surgical precision.” A similar ruling in Texas forced the state to water down its discriminatory voter ID requirements, allowing voters to use registration cards and other forms of ID that Black and Latinx people are equally likely to possess.

As the courts protect poll access, Trump’s path to depressing minority voter turnout is getting increasingly narrow. America is wising up to Republican attempts to turn back the clock on voting rights, and they are saying no.

"The national media desperately want to convince the American public that Hillary is unloved and unpopular. It is a pervasive and pernicious narrative that marginalizes the millions of people who like, admire and support her. The reality is very different from the media spin.

Here’s the headline trumpeting a new ABC News/Washington Post survey: Poll: Clinton Unpopularity at New High, on Par With Trump.

This is the traditional media’s favorite storyline: Hillary is hated. Her opponents repeat the point incessantly, hoping it will convince the world that she deserves to be shunned.

Yet somehow she keeps winning. It vexes them.

Let’s get behind the spin.

That same ABC/WaPo poll that paints Hillary as an outcast contains inconvenient details for her detractors:

Four out of five Democrats view Hillary favorably, as do four out of five Blacks. Her favorability is nearly 2-1 among non-whites overall.

So the negative numbers are coming from Republicans and Independents who are inundated with Hillary hate day and night. It is an unfortunate fact of her candidacy and career that she is subjected to inordinate levels of negativity, unlike anything any other candidate has endured. That avalanche of invective is bound to suppress her favorability among certain segments of the public.

There’s one more crucial detail missing from the unceasing narrative that Hillary is deeply unpopular — as promulgated in the ABC headline — namely, that she and Trump are viewed negatively for polar opposite reasons. He, because he is a bigot and bully; she, because she is furiously, continuously and unfairly maligned.

Those are the facts."
"Someone once said that if you ever want to know what conservatives are doing, just listen to what they’re accusing progressives of doing. This is projection — and Donald Trump is a master of it.

Trump is so good at projection that he should drop his presidential bid and get a job at a cinema. https://t.co/faKzsH6JHO — Melissa McEwan (@Shakestweetz) July 28, 2016

As I’ve written many times before, once you realize everything Trump says is projection, it all makes so much more sense. What he says about other people – particularly when he is accusing them of something – is a confession about himself.

This is something my colleague Sarah Kendzior has observed numerous times, too.

Everything Trump is saying about Obama is projection. Every single line. — Sarah Kendzior (@sarahkendzior) July 27, 2016

When Trump insults rival, it's often projection — describing himself. For weeks, he says HRC secretly ill. Now he cancels multiple events ???? — Sarah Kendzior (@sarahkendzior) August 23, 2016

My colleague Peter Daou sums it up thus:

His new approach: Talk about himself and replace his name with #Hillary. https://t.co/sSPVeX5J0z — Peter Daou (@peterdaou) August 26, 2016

Trump overtly talks and talks and talks about himself – and when he talks about other people, he’s still talking about himself. It’s just that he’s projecting his own flaws and failures onto them.

When he calls Hillary a “bigot,” he is really talking about himself. When he says that Hillary gives speeches that are devoid of policy, he is really talking about himself. When he accuses her of asserting that she has claimed to be able to solve systemic injustice, he is projecting onto her the claims he’s made.

I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2016

I am the only one who can fix this. Very sad. Will not happen under my watch! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/8MQ4imuTTi — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13, 2016

And sometimes he gives away the game, tacitly acknowledging a criticism of him that has been made, only to flip it around and accuse Hillary (or someone else on his radar) of being the “only one” deserving of that criticism.

Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2016

One of his favorite – and oft-repeated – bits of projection is the assertion that the media are being unfair to him and giving him terrible coverage, despite the fact that the media have been tipping the scales for him, giving him less negative coverage than Hillary, after decades of subjecting her to unfair coverage.

It’s been estimated that Trump had gotten $2 billion of free press by March of this year, and yet still he bitterly projects that it is Hillary who is treated with kid gloves.

Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads – all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street. Media is protecting her! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2016

I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds, but the media refuses to show or discuss them. Something very big is happening! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2016

It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact, that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2016

He doesn’t even pause to consider how foolish what he’s saying actually is. The media are “against” him, and yet “virtually everyone” is reporting his unfair treatment. How does that work?

He undercuts his own argument – because, the truth is, he’s not talking about himself. He’s talking about his opponent, about whom Mark Halperin, the quintessential media insider, recently conceded: “There’s a deep well of anti-Clinton sentiment in the press.”

Every negative thing Trump says about Hillary is a disclosure about himself. The answer to the ubiquitous rhetorical “how can he so utterly lack self-awareness” is that he doesn’t. He knows himself very well indeed. He just projects his worst qualities onto other people.

Hillary said in her powerful speech detailing his mainstreaming of white nationalism that “there’s no other Donald Trump. This is it.” He has, she noted, “shown us exactly who he is. We should believe him.”

And we should closely watch what he says about other people, because he is always telling us something about himself.

These unintentional disclosures are a warning to us about who he really is.

"We’ve done the research: Hillary’s emails have been covered by major media outlets every single day for the past year. The polls show that email fatigue has set in: 63% in a recent poll said they were tired of hearing about the issue. But her detractors keep beating a dead horse. The reason: They’ve got nothing else.

Having worked on two presidential campaigns, I’ve learned not to take anything from the outside at face value. Head fakes are standard operating procedure. Reporters who claim inside information are typically being fed trial balloons. Pundits who sit on the sidelines and pontificate about campaign tactics rarely have access to the sophisticated data available to senior strategists. Armchair campaign managers on cable news get things wrong more often than they get them right.

Conventional political wisdom is rarely actual wisdom but merely repetition and habit.

Which brings me to the matter of Hillary’s emails, the most over-hyped political story of the decade. The issue is not necessarily what it appears to be.

There was always going to be something Hillary’s opponents tried to derail her with, something the national media would latch onto and refuse to let go.

It could have been a dozen other trumped-up issues. It ended up being the emails. So be it.

As we head into the fall, there’s little doubt that the emails will be flogged by Hillary’s detractors every day for the remainder of the election. But does that actually hurt her? Or does it help?

Consider that the comprehensive FBI investigation led to no evidence or accusation of intentional wrongdoing on her part, nor any charges of misconduct. And consider that despite month after month of emails, emails, emails, Hillary is in a strong position to win in November.

Now why should we assume that hammering the email story for the remaining days of the campaign will somehow magically accomplish what an entire year of obsessive coverage hasn’t been able to do?

This may sound counter-intuitive but it’s a logical conclusion from the facts: Every day Hillary’s opponents flog her emails is a day she’s winning.

Simply because it’s a day they’re not landing any serious blows on anything else.

So keep at the emails, Hillary critics. And we’ll see how far the issue gets you on Election Day.

[Updated 8/31/16]"
"Another day, another profoundly objectionable comment about women from the Team Trump. This time, it’s care of his newly named campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who said if only women were as physically strong as men, there would be no more rape.

The Democratic Coalition Against Trump unearthed video of a January 2013 PBS panel, featuring a number of women from across the political spectrum discussing the issue of women in the military. Conway, expressing concern that women aren’t as strong as men, said: “If we were physiologically as strong as men, rape would not exist. You would be able to defend yourself and fight him off.”

Watch:

I cannot – and will not – soft-pedal this: What Conway said is utterly horrendous. It is an utter fallacy that “rape would not exist” if women were as strong as men, because rape is not exclusively a physical struggle between a man and a physically weaker woman.

Women who are incapacitated are raped. Women who are physically disabled are raped. Women who are physically stronger than their rapists are raped, through coercion or a number of other means, including having a gun held at their heads. There are women who are scared to try to defend themselves for fear that it will escalate the rape into something deadly. There are women who are virtually paralyzed by the shock of the assault.

There are also men who are raped – and not always by men who are physically weaker than they are.

This is, unfortunately, not a comprehensive list of the many ways in rape is more than just a sheer battle of physical force.

Conway is espousing an absurdly and harmfully reductive definition of rape, which frames rape as a power struggle between a stronger man and a weaker woman – which suggests that if only women were somehow better, bigger, tougher, mightier, we should be able to prevent rape.

Tasking victims with rape prevention is a key tenet of the rape culture. Rape prevention lies exclusively with predators, who have the responsibility to not rape people.

As you might imagine, I am not the only woman who is decidedly unhappy with Conway’s contemptible comment. A number of women’s groups have released statements expressing their disappointment with yet more sexist swill emanating from the Trump campaign.

NARAL Pro-Choice America National Communications Director Kaylie Hanson Long:

Another day, another offensive, outrageous moment from Team Trump. This Todd Akin moment from Kellyanne Conway reveals yet another example of how out of touch and disgusting the Trump campaign is, starting with its candidate. Combine Donald Trump’s misogynistic rhetoric and policies with senior advisers like Steve Bannon, Roger Ailes, and even Mike Pence—who have all built their careers on demeaning women or worse—and you’ve got a recipe for disaster in the White House.

EMILY’s List Vice President of Communications Marcy Stech:

Donald Trump should stand up for women and speak out against these comments – but women know he won’t, which is why he is unfit to be president. Kellyanne Conway isn’t the first campaign staffer Donald Trump has hired whose blatantly out-of-touch views mirror his own extreme agenda. Like the others in Trump’s inner circle who have made offensive, outrageous remarks about women, Conway is just plain wrong—and it’s just more of the same from the Trump campaign.

Planned Parenthood:

Conway fits a dangerous Trump campaign pattern of not understanding or caring about the struggles, discrimination, and even sexual violence that women face every day in this country.

It doesn’t get any blunter – or righter – than that."
"Many Senators, while serving, consider D.C. their home away from home, retaining primary residences in their home states — but Roy Blunt appears to not even consider his Missouri property a residence at all, sticking taxpayers with the bill when he’s supposedly visiting “home.”

Roy Blunt said he would fight corruption in Washington, even promising that he’d reform lobbying rules if elected. Yet he has become exactly the kind of insider he railed against. In fact, there is evidence that he doesn’t even live in his own home state. Blunt and his wife own a condominium in Springfield, MO, which Blunt purchased in 2013 at a discount from a public foreclosure auction.

But look at these numbers on the unit, grabbed from the Springfield City Utility Usage Report:

Blunt’s condo averaged 346.15 kilowatt-hours and $38.38 a month for utilities, which is a third the average consumption of neighboring units.

Meanwhile, this is Blunt’s property in Washington, D.C.:

Blunt has a 7-bedroom, 4-and-a-half bathroom mansion in the Beltway and a small condominium he hardly ever visits in his home state. He has billed taxpayers thousands of dollars in per diem expenses for trips taken to Missouri, including trips to his supposed “hometown” of Springfield.

Here is a sample sheet documenting Blunt’s per diems in Springfield for October 2011-March 2012. According to the report of Blunt’s Senate office expenditures over a longer five-year period, of the roughly $21,000 in taxpayer money Blunt has taken for his trips to Missouri, nearly $3,000 of it was in trips through the town where he supposedly lives.

Has Blunt violated the requirements of office? The Constitutional provision that a senator “be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen” is vague enough that Blunt is in compliance with the letter of the law, if not the spirit, by owning a condo in Springfield which he barely ever uses. But meeting the technical requirements for residency rules nonetheless raises questions about why he is using a per diem while he is ostensibly “at home.”

Missourians deserve to be represented by a person who has stronger ties to the state of Missouri, and who doesn’t bill the taxpayer for hanging out in the town in which he claims to live.

"West Baltimore — Lenny Epps was convicted of eight counts—including first degree rape, false imprisonment, and using a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence— stemming from a rape and seven hour standoff with police in 2015. At the time, Epps was on federal parole for murdering a state’s witness in 1984.

On October 10, 2015, Epps was discussing his relationship with his girlfriend—the victim in this case— when she left to go to work. When she returned from work, Epps tried to initiate sex with the woman, but was told “no” because she believed he was cheating.

Epps then asked how long he would be denied sex before declaring, “Turn over, we going to do this **** my way today.” Epps pressed the tip of an ice pick against the side of her neck. While straddling the woman, Epps reached over to the night stand and grabbed a set of white ropes.

Using the ropes, Epps bound the woman’s hands then tied her left wrist to her left ankle and her right wrist to her right ankle. He used a pair of scissors to cut the woman’s clothes off. Next, Epps propped the woman up on pillows, retrieved Vaseline from the bathroom, and began his assault.

During the attack, he forced the woman to drink vodka to “put her in the mood.” She protested, but was forced to drink until she vomited. Epps then placed a sock into her mouth and duct taped her mouth shut. Throughout the attack, Epps held a gun to the woman.

The woman asked Epps to loosen the restraints so that she could use the bathroom. While she was in the bathroom, Epps ordered delivery food. The woman escaped by climbing out of the bathroom window when she heard Epps go downstairs to speak with the delivery driver.

The woman—naked— ran across the porch roofs of her neighbors’ homes as she was being chased by Epps. At the end of the row, she jumped to the ground, fracturing her hip. Despite her injury, she continued to run as Epps chased behind her with the gun. Three witnesses came to the woman’s aid during the chase.

Epps broke off pursuit and returned to the street where the woman lived in the 2700 block of Baker Street. He began banging on the window of a resident who lived two doors down from the victim. The neighbor ran screaming from her home and Epps forced his way inside. At some point, Epps left that residence and returned to his victim’s home where he barricaded himself inside.

A SWAT team was called and a seven-hour standoff ensued. Epps eventually surrendered after speaking to his lawyer.

“I commend the incredible bravery, intelligence, and strength it took for the survivor of this attack to escape and work with us to send Epps back to prison,” State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said. “Every woman has a right to determine the fate of her own bodies, and she was well within those rights to deny intercourse at any point—whether they were together or not.”

Mosby praised the SWAT Team that was able to convince Epps to end the standoff peacefully.

“These situations are tense for everyone involved,” continued Mosby. “We are grateful for the way those officers conducted themselves that night.”

Epps is facing two Life sentences plus 42 years for his crimes. He is scheduled for sentencing on July 17, 2017."
"West Baltimore — Lenny Epps was convicted of eight counts—including first degree rape, false imprisonment, and using a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence— stemming from a rape and seven hour standoff with police in 2015. At the time, Epps was on federal parole for murdering a state’s witness in 1984.

On October 10, 2015, Epps was discussing his relationship with his girlfriend—the victim in this case— when she left to go to work. When she returned from work, Epps tried to initiate sex with the woman, but was told “no” because she believed he was cheating.

Epps then asked how long he would be denied sex before declaring, “Turn over, we going to do this **** my way today.” Epps pressed the tip of an ice pick against the side of her neck. While straddling the woman, Epps reached over to the night stand and grabbed a set of white ropes.

Using the ropes, Epps bound the woman’s hands then tied her left wrist to her left ankle and her right wrist to her right ankle. He used a pair of scissors to cut the woman’s clothes off. Next, Epps propped the woman up on pillows, retrieved Vaseline from the bathroom, and began his assault.

During the attack, he forced the woman to drink vodka to “put her in the mood.” She protested, but was forced to drink until she vomited. Epps then placed a sock into her mouth and duct taped her mouth shut. Throughout the attack, Epps held a gun to the woman.

The woman asked Epps to loosen the restraints so that she could use the bathroom. While she was in the bathroom, Epps ordered delivery food. The woman escaped by climbing out of the bathroom window when she heard Epps go downstairs to speak with the delivery driver.

The woman—naked— ran across the porch roofs of her neighbors’ homes as she was being chased by Epps. At the end of the row, she jumped to the ground, fracturing her hip. Despite her injury, she continued to run as Epps chased behind her with the gun. Three witnesses came to the woman’s aid during the chase.

Epps broke off pursuit and returned to the street where the woman lived in the 2700 block of Baker Street. He began banging on the window of a resident who lived two doors down from the victim. The neighbor ran screaming from her home and Epps forced his way inside. At some point, Epps left that residence and returned to his victim’s home where he barricaded himself inside.

A SWAT team was called and a seven-hour standoff ensued. Epps eventually surrendered after speaking to his lawyer.

“I commend the incredible bravery, intelligence, and strength it took for the survivor of this attack to escape and work with us to send Epps back to prison,” State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said. “Every woman has a right to determine the fate of her own bodies, and she was well within those rights to deny intercourse at any point—whether they were together or not.”

"NEWARK, N.J. — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers arrested two individuals, one from Mexico and one from Honduras, after they were released from the custody of Middlesex County with active ICE detainers in place.

On April 14, 2016, ICE lodged an immigration detainer on Elder Antonio Quintero Rodriguez, a Honduran citizen. On May 19, 2017, the facility released him from custody without notifying ICE. Quintero Rodriguez has a felony conviction of endangering abuse; the neglect of a child. ERO Newark officers arrested him in New Brunswick, New Jersey, May 30, 2017.

On April 21, 2017, ICE lodged an immigration detainer on Rolando Herrera Saavedra, a Mexican citizen. On April 29, 2017, the facility released him from custody without notifying ICE. Herrera Saavedra is currently facing state criminal charges. ERO Newark officers arrested Herrera Saavedra in Long Branch, New Jersey, May 24, 2017.

Neither Herrera Saavedra nor Quintero Rodriguez has lawful status in the United States. Both remain in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.

“As a nation, we must protect the integrity of our immigration system and aggressively pursue the removal of illegal criminal aliens; this is one of ICE’s top priorities,” said John Tsoukaris, ERO Newark field office director. “ICE shares the county’s ultimate objective to protect public safety and national security while simultaneously preserving the critical community-police bond; however, counties such as Middlesex that fail to work with ICE in the transfer of custody of criminal aliens, place the citizens of their communities at serious risk.”

In fiscal year 2016, ICE removed or returned 240,255 individuals. Of this total, 174,923 were apprehended while, or shortly after, attempting to illegally enter the United States. The remaining 65,332 were apprehended in the interior of the United States, and the vast majority was convicted criminals."

"Evergreen State College in Washington state was abruptly evacuated and closed due to a ‘direct threat’ Thursday.

“In response to a direct threat to campus safety, the college is closing immediately for the day,” the college said in an alert to students and staff. “All are asked to leave campus or return to residence halls for instructions.”

No further details were given.

The school has been the scene of racial tensions lately. Leftist students have alleged racism from administrators and demanded all white people leave the campus for a “non-racist day of absence.”

"PHILIPPINES — At least one armed man stormed the ‘Resorts World Manila’ entertainment complex and casino in the Pasay City area of metro Manila early Thursday.

The resort initially said ‘unidentified men’ dressed in black entered the casino area with rifles and opened fire. Witnesses also reported hearing explosions as smoke filled the air outside.

Philippine armed forces later said police had full control of the incident and nobody was shot. Officials said ‘only tables’ were set on fire.

Southern Police District Chief Tomas Apolinario now says at least 34 dead bodies have been found inside Resorts World Manila, mostly female victims, who died of smoke inhalation. Police say robbery remains the motive.

CNN mocked President Donald Trump for suggesting the incident was terror related.

SITE reported the Islamic State is claiming responsibility for the siege, this was not confirmed by Breaking911.

The suspect was later found dead after reportedly setting himself on fire inside of the establishment.

Resorts World released the following statement:

CNN Philippines reported: The victims did not appear to have been shot, but indications were that they had suffocated, Bureau of Fire Protection, Southern Police District Director P/Supt. Tomas Apolinario said.

“It’s too early to tell, but so far as we are concerned there was no ISIS,” [the official] said.

“If this is ISIS, all the people gambling inside should have been shot or already been bombed. He didn’t hurt anyone. Those who were injured got their injuries when they jumped from the windows,” he added.

Video posted online showed gunfire and a massive police response—people were seen running from the building in panic.

"On Wednesday, at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn, New York, Tairod Pugh, an American citizen and former member of the U.S. Air Force, was sentenced to 35 years in prison following his March 9, 2016 trial conviction for attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, the Islamic State.

Before traveling overseas to try to join ISIS, the defendant served in the U.S. Air Force as an avionics instrument system specialist and received training in the installation and maintenance of aircraft engines, navigation, and weapons systems. The defendant later worked as an airplane mechanic for numerous companies in the United States and Middle East. He lived abroad for more than one year before his arrest in this case.

On January 10, 2015, the defendant traveled from Egypt to Turkey in an effort to cross the border into Syria to join ISIS to engage in violent “jihad.” Turkish authorities denied the defendant entry and returned him to Egypt. At the time of his detention, the defendant was carrying a laptop computer and four USB drives that he had stripped of their plastic casings in an effort to destroy their contents and thereby make them unavailable to investigators. The defendant also was carrying solar powered chargers, compasses, a black balaclava, and clothing suitable for war-torn Syria. Foreign government officials quickly deported the defendant to the United States, where the FBI closely monitored him, relying in part on a covert undercover employee who encountered the defendant at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The defendant was arrested on January 16, 2015, in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and thereafter indicted in the Eastern District of New York.

The defendant’s laptop contained Internet searches for “borders controlled by Islamic state,” the ISIS propaganda video “Flames of War,” as well as terrorist videos he had downloaded, including ISIS execution videos. In the months before he attempted to join ISIS, the defendant made statements to coworkers and on social media establishing his support for ISIS, including advising Facebook followers to “support [ISIS] with your bodies.”

Shortly before he left Egypt for Turkey on his way to Syria, the defendant drafted a letter proclaiming, “I am a Mujahid. I am a sword against the oppressor and a shield for the oppressed. I will use the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic State. There is only 2 possible outcomes for me. Victory or Martyr.”

“The defendant turned his back on his country, and the military he once served, to attempt to join a brutally violent terrorist organization committed to the slaughter of innocent people throughout the world,” stated Acting United States Attorney Rohde. “Today’s sentence sends a powerful message that those who support terrorism will be brought to justice by this Office and our law enforcement partners, undeterred by obstructionist efforts.” Ms. Rohde expressed her appreciation to the members of the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, which comprises federal, state, and local agencies from across the region, for their work on the investigation.

“With this sentence, Tairod Pugh – an American citizen and former member of the U.S. Air Force where he served as an aircraft mechanic – is being held accountable for attempting to travel to Syria to provide material support to ISIS,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Boente. “We are committed to bringing to justice all those who seek to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations. I would like to thank all of the agents, analysts, and prosecutors who are responsible for this result.”

“The alarming reality of this case is that Pugh served in the U.S. military but ultimately traded in his pledge to defend the United States to defend the Islamic State,” stated Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney. “Today’s sentencing should send a strong message to those who seek to support terrorists groups — they will face serious consequences for their actions. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force will continue to work with our partners, both here and abroad, to prevent acts of terrorism. This investigation demonstrates the importance of law enforcement coordination and collaboration here and around the world.”

“The defendant broke his oath to defend our nation and instead made repeated attempts to join ISIL on the battlefield of Syria,” stated Commissioner O’Neill. “The work of protecting New York City from those who seek to harm us is ever present. I am thankful for the work of so many whose diligence helps keep this city safe.”"

"NEW YORK – The entire administration of the Luchese Family, as well as the captains, soldiers and associates, 19 members in total, are being charged with racketeering, murder, narcotics and firearms offenses.

The superseding indictment builds on charges previously filed against Luchese soldier Christopher Londonio and Luchese associate Terrence Caldwell, who were charged in February 2017 with racketeering offenses, including the murder of Michael Meldish, a Luchese associate who was killed in the Bronx November 15, 2013.

The superseding indictment charges Matthew Madonna, the alleged street boss of the Luchese Family, Steven Crea Sr., the alleged underboss of the Family, and Steven Crea Jr., Londonio’s alleged captain in the Family, with ordering the murder of Meldish. The superseding indictment also contains additional racketeering charges against Madonna, Crea Sr., and Crea Jr., as well as the alleged consigliere of the Luchese Family, Joseph Dinapoli, and numerous other members and associates of La Cosa Nostra.

Fifteen of the defendants charged were taken into custody Wednesday. Christopher Londonio, Terrence Caldwell and Vincent Bruno were already in federal custody on other charges. Matthew Madonna was already in custody on state charges and was transferred today to federal custody.

According to the allegations in the superseding indictment, which was filed in White Plains federal court on May 24, 2017, and was unsealed Wednesday, La Cosa Nostra or “the Mafia” is a criminal organization composed of leaders, members, and associates who work together and coordinate to engage in criminal activities.

La Cosa Nostra operates through entities known as “Families.” In the New York City area, those families include the Genovese, Gambino, Luchese, Bonanno, Colombo, and Decavalcante Families. Each Family operates through groups of individuals known as “crews” and “regimes.” Each “crew” has as its leader a person known as a “Caporegime,” “Capo,” “Captain,” or “Skipper,” who is responsible for supervising the criminal activities of his crew and providing “Soldiers” and associates with support and protection. In return, the Capo typically receives a share of the illegal earnings of each of his crew’s Soldiers and associates, which is sometimes referred to as “Attribute”.

Each crew consists of “made” members, sometimes known as “Soldiers,” “wiseguys,” “friends of ours,” and “good fellows.” Soldiers are aided in their criminal endeavors by other trusted individuals, known as “associates,” who sometimes are referred to as “connected” or identified as “with” a Soldier or other member of the Family. Associates participate in the various activities of the crew and its members. In order for an associate to become a made member of the Family, the associate must first be of Italian descent and typically needs to demonstrate the ability to generate income for the Family and the willingness to commit acts of violence.

At most times relevant to the charges in the superseding indictment, Matthew Madonna was the street boss of the family; that is, the individual who managed the affairs of the Family on behalf of the formal boss, who is serving a life sentence in federal prison. Steven Crea Sr., a/k/a “Wonder Boy,” was the Underboss of the Luchese Family, and Joseph Dinapoli was the Consigliere of the Luchese Family. Additionally, Steven Crea Jr., Dominic Truscello, John Castelucci, a/k/a “Big John,” and Tindaro Corso, a/k/a “Tino,” were Captains or Acting Captains in the Luchese Family. Joseph Venice, James Maffucci, a/k/a “Jimmy the Jew,” Joseph Datello, a/k/a “Big Joe,” a/k/a “Joey Glasses,” Paul Cassano, a/k/a “Paulie Roast Beef,” and Christopher Londonio were Soldiers in the Luchese Family.

The superseding indictment alleges that from at least in or about 2000 up to and including in or about 2017, Matthew Madonna, Steven Crea Sr., Joseph Dinapoli, Steven Crea Jr., Dominic Truscello, John Castelucci, Tindaro Corso, Joseph Venice, James Maffucci, Joseph Datello, Paul Cassano, Christopher Londonio, Terrence Caldwell, a/k/a “T,” Vincent Bruno, Brian Vaughan, Carmine Garcia, a/k/a “Spanish Carmine,” Richard O’Connor, Robert Camilli, and John Incatasciato, along with other members and associates of La Cosa Nostra, committed a wide array of crimes in connection with their association with the mafia, including murder, attempted murder, assault, robbery, extortion, gambling, narcotics trafficking, witness tampering, fraud, money laundering and trafficking in contraband cigarettes.

Of particular significance, on or about November 15, 2013, Madonna, Crea Sr. Crea Jr., Londonio, and Caldwell murdered and procured the murder of Michael Meldish in order to maintain or increase their status in La Cosa Nostra.

The superseding indictment also alleges the following additional violent incidents:

In late 2012, Paul Cassano and Vincent Bruno, acting at the direction of Crea Sr. and Crea Jr., attempted to murder a mafia associate who had shown disrespect toward Crea Sr.

As charged in the initial Indictment, on May 29, 2013, Terrence Caldwell attempted to murder a Bonanno Soldier in the vicinity of First Avenue and 111th Street, in Manhattan.

In or about October 2016, Steven Crea Sr. and Joseph Datello attempted to murder a witness who had previously provided information regarding the activities of La Cosa Nostra to state and federal law enforcement."

"(Scroll down for video) — New video obtained by the Orlando Sentinel shows the heroic moment police storm the Pulse nightclub during the June 2016 terrorist attack that killed 49.

Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old security guard and radical Islamist, was shot and killed by Orlando Police Department (OPD) officers after a three-hour standoff. Pulse was hosting a “Latin Night” and thus most of the victims were Latinos. It was both the deadliest mass shooting by a single shooter and the deadliest incident of violence against LGBT people in United States history.

In a 9-1-1 call shortly after the shooting began, Mateen swore allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and said the shooting was “triggered” by the U.S. killing of Abu Waheeb in Iraq the previous month. He later told a negotiator he was “out here right now” because of the American-led interventions in Iraq and in Syria, and that the negotiator should tell the United States to stop bombing.

Initial reports said Mateen may have been a patron of the nightclub and used gay dating websites and apps, but Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials said they have not found any credible evidence to substantiate these claims. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also conducted an investigation and said it found no links between ISIL and Mateen."

"FBI, Chicago Police Department Work to Combat Violent Crime

Tuesday, April 18, 8:15 a.m.: Along the 5100 block of Halsted Street on the South Side of Chicago, a quiet spring morning is interrupted by gunfire. Police respond to a gas station and discover a drive-by double homicide. As they secure the crime scene and work to identify the bodies and recover evidence, distraught family members of the victims begin to arrive, their faces full of anguish and disbelief. They will not be alone in their grief. By the end of the day in a city reeling from violent crime, there will be 13 more shootings and another murder.

Chicago’s extreme gun violence—762 homicides last year and more than 4,000 people wounded—has been described as an epidemic. Primarily gang-related, the shootings are often spontaneous and unpredictable, and the toll on victims, families, and entire communities cannot be overstated. That’s why the FBI’s Chicago Division, working with the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and other agencies, has undertaken significant measures to address the problem.

“The FBI sometimes battles a perception that we are only interested in terrorism or public corruption or large drug-trafficking organizations,” said Michael Anderson, special agent in charge of the Chicago Division. “The fact is, we are interested in those things, but in Chicago we are also getting down to the street level to address violent crime, and we are specifically going after the trigger-pullers and shot-callers.”

That street-level focus is in response to a city homicide rate that has “increased exponentially,” Anderson said. “The number of shootings is at a level that hasn’t been seen here since the early 1990s.” As a result, he explained, “what you are seeing and will continue to see in Chicago is a sustained FBI effort to support and supplement our local partners.”

That effort involves three major areas:

– The creation in 2016 of a homicide task force—in addition to the FBI’s existing violent crimes squad—in which agents work alongside CPD detectives and other law enforcement officers to assist in solving the city’s murder cases;

– Increased intelligence-gathering efforts to identify shooters and “directors of violence,” which includes embedding FBI analysts at CPD headquarters; and

– Stepping up community outreach efforts to gain the public’s trust and enlist their help in solving crimes and making communities safer.

“Simply put,” said CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson, “the FBI has more resources than we do. We combine the resources we have with the ones they have to fight these crimes.”

FBI and CPD personnel working together in the city’s most violent neighborhoods “has helped quite a bit,” Johnson said. “And we get real-time intelligence from the FBI that we didn’t get before. They can look at our crime picture and help us figure out where to best deploy our resources.”

Johnson, a Chicago native and 29-year veteran of the police force who spent many years as a patrol officer, believes a key reason for the city’s current violence is inadequate gun laws.

“The flow of guns into Chicago is just insane,” he said. “You will find that gang members would rather be caught with a gun by law enforcement than caught without one by their rivals. What we have to do through legislation is create a mentality where gang members won’t want to pick up a gun,” he explained. “You create that by holding them accountable for their actions. We simply don’t do a good job of that right now.”

Johnson recalled that when he joined CPD in 1988, he and fellow officers responded daily to calls of gang fights in progress. “We rarely hear that call anymore,” he said. “What we hear now is a person with a gun or a person shot. They just go straight to a firearm and they resolve their disputes with a weapon.”

“Communities are being hijacked by a relatively small percentage of people,” Anderson said. “The overwhelming majority of residents are hard-working citizens going to work, going to school, trying to go about their daily lives. These communities are under siege, and they are desperately looking for help.”

Of Chicago’s 22 police districts, the majority of violent crimes are taking places in a cluster of neighborhoods on the South and West Sides. “A handful of districts—probably five or six—are responsible for the disproportionate number of homicides and shootings,” Anderson said.

FBI and CPD investigators have focused considerable effort on two of the city’s most historically violent areas—the 11th District on the West Side and the 7th District on the South Side. “Since we put the task force in place,” Johnson said, “we’ve seen significant drops in gun violence in these two districts. We are making some real positive gains,” he said. “By no means are we declaring success, but we have seen some really encouraging results.”

Driving through the city’s most violent neighborhoods—Austin, Englewood, North Lawndale, Auburn Gresham—the streets and parks appear peaceful, and often they are. But when the violence comes, it is sudden and usually without warning. One gang member might have disrespected a rival gang member—increasingly through social media (see sidebar)—and they go looking for each other to settle matters with their guns.

“When I started as a cop,” Johnson said, “if you had a gang of 10 guys, maybe two of them at most would be armed. Now if you have a gang of 10 guys, probably nine of them are armed. And we’ve seen kids as young as 10 and 11 with firearms.”

Investigators agree that gang members are arming themselves at younger ages. “Based on what I’ve seen over the last year,” one FBI agent said, “these guys are carrying around guns as if it’s a symbol of their pride or who they are—and the bigger the gun, the better. We are seeing handguns with extended magazines and ammunition drums attached. It’s like guns are a part of them, a part of their culture. And they are not afraid to use them.”

The FBI is working to reach some of these youngsters before they get involved with gangs—it’s one part of the Bureau’s larger community outreach effort in the campaign to stop gun violence. At the Plato Learning Academy middle school in the Austin community recently, Special Agent Rob Fortt spoke to sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-graders about the choices they make and the consequences of those choices.

The school’s principal, Charles Williams, welcomed the opportunity for the FBI to give students a fresh perspective on law enforcement and a positive message about making good decisions. Describing the neighborhood’s reputation for violence, Williams said he has heard gunshots in the middle of the day from his office, and violent crime is a fact of life. “Our students are surrounded by it, unfortunately. It’s just something that permeates the neighborhood.”

Gang-related homicides in Chicago are most easily solved when witnesses come forward. But in the city’s violent neighborhoods, many who witness shootings or have information don’t cooperate with law enforcement, either because they distrust the police or they want to engage in “frontier justice” and seek their own retaliation, the FBI’s Anderson said. “So we are putting a lot of resources into community outreach. We are really focusing on going out in the community and building trust. If folks trust law enforcement, they are more likely to report crimes.”"

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami confirmed the news: “The U.S. Attorney’s Office family is deeply saddened by his death. He was a wonderful lawyer and great colleague. We will miss him deeply. Our thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family.”

According to local media, the 37-year-old may have suffered trauma—an official cause of death was not yet made public.

“When the tide came in he obviously was caught in the surf and tumbling, about a 35-year-old African-American man, very well dressed wearing a sort of a casual business shirt, black pants, and all of his personal effects were on him and that’s what we found unusual,” witness Bill Renick told WTVJ.

Whisenant worked in the Major Crimes Unit where he was overseeing several visa and passport fraud cases.

The investigation is ongoing.

According to local media, the 37-year-old may have suffered trauma—an official cause of death was not yet made public.

“When the tide came in he obviously was caught in the surf and tumbling, about a 35-year-old African-American man, very well dressed wearing a sort of a casual business shirt, black pants, and all of his personal effects were on him and that’s what we found unusual,” witness Bill Renick told WTVJ.

Whisenant worked in the Major Crimes Unit where he was overseeing several visa and passport fraud cases.

The investigation is ongoing.

"EL CENTRO, Calif. – El Centro Sector Border Patrol agents, assigned to the west desert area, stopped a vehicle loaded with drugs after it entered the United States using metal ramps to drive over vehicle barricades on Sunday morning.

The incident occurred at approximately 11 a.m., after agents assigned to the remote video surveillance system (RVSS) observed a White Chevy Tahoe drive into the United States about 400 yards north of the United States/Mexico International Border.

Agents in the area responded to the area. As the agents approached the Chevy Tahoe’s location the men in the vehicle turned back south to abscond.

Border Patrol advised the Mexican military of the incursion and responded to the area. One of the men decided to return to the United States and was apprehended by a Border Patrol agents. The other man’s disposition is presently unknown.

“This incident demonstrates the importance of our RVSS system as an integral part of our border technology,” said Special Operations Supervisor Miguel Garcia. “The vigilance by our Border Patrol agents and their ability to rapidly respond is crucial in stopping dangerous narcotics from entering our communities, while keeping our nation’s borders safe.” Special Operations Supervisor Garcia added, “This is also an example of great interagency work between Mexican officials and the Border Patrol.”

Border Patrol agents later returned to the area of the initial incursion and discovered several metal ramps used to circumvent the in-place vehicle barricades.

Agents seized the Chevy Tahoe and 978.85 lbs. of marijuana that was stuffed inside the vehicle. The marijuana has a street value of $391,540."

"An NYPD Police Academy recruit on field training played a major role in catching a bank robber in Manhattan last week.

“I had been an NYPD school safety agent for five years and was able to use my experience from that and my current Academy training to help,” said Probationary Police Officer Marky Sanchez. “I’m thankful that I had the opportunity to get this suspect off the street.”

On Friday, May 19, a group of police academy recruits including Probationary Police Officer (PPO) Marky Sanchez were travelling between field training locations when the description of a bank robbery suspect was broadcast over the police radio. The suspect had been spotted inside of a bank that he had previously robbed, but fled when approached by security.

Sergeant DelaCruz and Police Officer Otero of the 20 Precinct had been conducting the field training with the Academy recruits and decided to search the area for the suspect. When the officers observed the man fitting the description at 86 Street and Amsterdam Avenue, Police Officer Otero and PPO Sanchez stopped him. Officer Otero was able to surprise the suspect and apprehend him before he could flee. PPO Sanchez helped Officer Otero bring the suspect back to the station house where the 52-year-old man was charged with robbery.

“We stopped the van as soon as we saw the suspect matching the description and I jumped out and started running after him,” said Police Officer Otero. “Probationary Officer Sanchez’s training kicked right in and he didn’t even hesitate to help me apprehend the man.”"

"Former KKK Leader Reveals How ‘One Old Black Man Defeated The Entire Klu Klux Klan’

When hurt by someone all of us find it hard to forgive, forget and move forward. The thought of making a positive change in the life of the person who has hurt you would be the farthest from our minds. The story of Reverend Wade Watts is one that shows us the power of forgiveness and how the results of forgiveness cannot only change your attacker but the entire world.

‘Rev. Watts was like a father to me. I am grateful for all the years I had with him, and for all the wisdom and knowledge he passed on to me. He told me that he was passing me his mantle. I do not feel worthy to take it up; however, if he thought that much of me to invest all those years of time and wisdom into me, then I owe it to the memory of him to fight racism and continue his works. Wade and I always called one another “Old Partner”. I will miss him for the rest of my life, and will never forget him.”

–Johnny Lee Clary

Rev. Wade Watts passed away, Dec. 13th, 1998. The night he passed away, two of his daughters heard him talking as he laid in bed. They heard Wade say “Thank You, Sir!” They asked him, ” Dad, who are you talking to?”, since they were the only ones in the room with him. Wade replied, ” I am talking to Jesus. He said He is coming to take me home.”

"People Who Wear Crazy Socks Are More Creative, Rebellious and Successful

How do you feel about the socks you wear? You probably fall into one of two camps. Either black, blue grey will do, or socks are a way for you to show off your individuality, personality and non-conformed attitudes.

You think this is dramatic or crazy? Well, it turns out that new research demonstrates that novel and crazy socks you choose to wear not only reveal a lot about you, but also how you’re perceived by other people.

So what’s the key point?

By wearing crazy socks, you’ll be perceived to have more authority and will probably end up being more successful.

The Surprising Opportunity to Show Huge Potential

Many of us conform to be part of the pack without realizing it, and this especially shows up in the way we speak, act and dress.

When someone doesn’t conform to the behavior of the tribe, they are seen as strange, weird and a bit crazy and we often end up dismissing the unfamiliar. However, socks are a completely different ball game.

Socks sit at the bottom of our trousers and are unassuming. They are almost secretive.

They’re not the most obvious item of clothing. So it’s an opportunity to show off our individuality to anyone who happens to notice, without being obviously outlandish.

What Your Crazy Socks Say About You

A study published in the Journal of Consumer Research recently investigated the theory that people who are noncomformists are viewed as having higher status and more competent than those who conform to social norms.

What does this have to do with your decision to wear brightly colored or snake printed socks?

The study showed that people who have deliberately chosen to wear wacky socks are seen by others to have increased status and competency.

In other words:

People see those wearing wacky socks as being more brilliant, creative and successful.

“We proposed that, under certain conditions, nonconforming behaviours can be more beneficial to someone than simply trying to fit in. In other words, when it looks deliberate, a person can appear to have a higher status and sense of competency.”

Imagine a corporate business person dressed in a smart and expensive suit, only to have bright red socks under his pants. The boldness of the choice shows him to be outwardly conforming but revealing a rebellious and proud side.

Crazy Socks Show Our Uniqueness and Confidence

Dr. Adam Galinsky, a social psychologist from the Northwestern University, conducted a study that showed what we wear affects the way we think, feel and act.

When we put on our silly and crazy socks, we are partly showing off our uniqueness and our confidence. This then helps us get into the mindset of feeling good about ourselves. We are demonstrating to ourselves that we have the confidence to wear what we want and that we can embrace it.

This perception of ourselves helps us to develop a mentality of being successful.

Plain grey socks allow us to hide into the background of social norms whereas a nice pair of colored socks gives us the impression of giving two fingers up to the conforming attitudes of people around us.

If you’re a lover of fun and outlandish socks then go out in the world and embrace them.

You’ll end up giving off the perception of being a rebellious and creative spirit, and you’ll start to live up to that impression by cultivating a mindset of success.

"25 Enlightening Quotes From Thich Nhat Hanh That Will Change Your Perspective on Life

Ever heard of Thich Nhat Hanh? If you haven’t, he is master Buddhist teacher who is renowned for his amazing wisdom on self-compassion, mindfulness and peace.

After spending time in the US, he realized that many people were suffering under the misguided belief that attachment and material items lead to happiness. He sought to teach people a more meaningful way of existence that involves embracing the present moment and enriching the amount of love in our lives.

He truly is a wonderful zen master that has changed a countless number of people’s lives. Here are my most favorite quotes from Thich Nhat Hanh. I hope they inspire you as much as they inspire me!

On the Present Moment

“Breathing in, I calm body and mind. Breathing out, I smile. Dwelling in the present moment I know this is the only moment.”

“Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves – slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.”

“I promise myself that I will enjoy every minute of the day that is given me to live.”

“The mind can go in a thousand directions, but on this beautiful path, I walk in peace. With each step, the wind blows. With each step, a flower blooms.”

“When we are mindful, deeply in touch with the present moment, our understanding of what is going on deepens, and we begin to be filled with acceptance, joy, peace and love.”

On Suffering

“When another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help. That’s the message he is sending.”

“People have a hard time letting go of their suffering. Out of a fear of the unknown, they prefer suffering that is familiar.”

“The seed of suffering in you may be strong, but don’t wait until you have no more suffering before allowing yourself to be happy.”

“Suffering is not enough. Life is both dreadful and wonderful…How can I smile when I am filled with so much sorrow? It is natural–you need to smile to your sorrow because you are more than your sorrow.”

On Acceptance and Letting Go

“To be beautiful means to be yourself. You don’t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself.”

“Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness. If, in our heart, we still cling to anything – anger, anxiety, or possessions – we cannot be free.”

“For things to reveal themselves to us, we need to be ready to abandon our views about them.”

On How Lucky we are to be Alive

“People usually consider walking on water or in thin air a miracle. But I think the real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin air, but to walk on earth. Every day we are engaged in a miracle which we don’t even recognize: a blue sky, white clouds, green leaves, the black, curious eyes of a child — our own two eyes. All is a miracle.”

“Because you are alive, everything is possible.”

“Waking up this morning, I smile. Twenty-four brand new hours are before me. I vow to live fully in each moment and to look at all beings with eyes of compassion.”

On Understanding

“When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you

don’t blame the lettuce. You look for reasons it is not

doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or

less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have

problems with our friends or family, we blame the other

person. But if we know how to take care of them, they will

grow well, like the lettuce. Blaming has no positive

effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason

and argument. That is my experience. No blame, no

reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you

understand, and you show that you understand, you can

love, and the situation will change”

On Happiness

“Many people think excitement is happiness…. But when you are excited you are not peaceful. True happiness is based on peace.”

On Love

“Through my love for you, I want to express my love for the whole cosmos, the whole of humanity, and all beings. By living with you, I want to learn to love everyone and all species. If I succeed in loving you, I will be able to love everyone and all species on Earth… This is the real message of love.”

“If you love someone but rarely make yourself available to him or her, that is not true love.”

“You must love in such a way that the person you love feels free.”

“The source of love is deep in us and we can help others realize a lot of happiness. One word, one action, one thought can reduce another person’s suffering and bring that person joy.”

On Hope

“Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today.”

On Health

“Keeping your body healthy is an expression of gratitude to the whole cosmos — the trees, the clouds, everything.”

On Learning

“The secret of Buddhism is to remove all ideas, all concepts, in order for the truth to have a chance to penetrate, to reveal itself.”

“Usually when we hear or read something new, we just compare it to our own ideas. If it is the same, we accept it and say that it is correct. If it is not, we say it is incorrect. In either case, we learn nothing.”

"5 Powerful Mindfulness Secrets for a Happier and Productive Life

If you want to look for a place to start finding your inner peace, look to mindfulness.

Mindfullness orignated from Zen Buddhism and will guide you to find the road to happiness and peace, although you have to remember, following Buddha’’s instructions won’t ultimately provide these states of mind, it will only teach you how to find it.

Buddha’s intention was not to tell you what to do but to encourage you to focus on your own direct experience and pave the path for yourself.

If you want the crash course for the Zen life, here are 5 things to help guide you:

1) Sitting and Meditating

This one you would’ve heard before and probably one of the top things that come to mind when you think of Zen Buddhism and mindfulness. It’s called Zazen in Zen Buddhism and it is proven to lower your stress and anxiety levels.

A lot of people may seem skeptical of this practice and don’t bother trying because they don’t believe they can reach enlightenment.

The truth is it doesn’t have to be about reaching enlightenment. It simply is to slow your pace of life down and to sit, relax and not think of your daily tasks that are bothering you. It’s a quick escape from reality, a time to let your brain rest.

Like every other skill, the more you practice, the better you’ll get at it. You’ll feel a lot more refreshed and focused after a couple sessions.

2) Finding a Mindful State



Similar but a little different to Zazen, being in a mindful state can be when you’re still in action.

It’s to draw your thoughts to the present reality and to focus on what it is you’re doing. To wake up and feel grounded with your surroundings. It’s to forget worrying about your tasks you need to get done later in the day or what you will be doing in a month’s time. Focus on the present time.

The practice of mindfulness in itself isn’t difficult, but continuing to remain present in any moment does require awareness – of when your thoughts are not present or when you are being judgemental of your situation or surroundings, or your mind is elsewhere.

3) Cultivating Compassion



As the Dalai Lama said, compassion is an aspiration, not just a passive emotion. This is a big part of Buddhism learnings. To learn how to express compassion to the ones around us will give us a deeper sense of peace and happiness. It may be one of the most difficult things we learn, but it will be one worthwhile and will bring stronger bonds to relationships.

Perhaps the Dalai Lama says it best with this wise quote:

“Only the development of compassion and understanding for others can bring us the tranquility and happiness we all seek.”

4) Finding the Road to Happiness



While things like money, power and success bring some people happiness, those things tend to be temporary relief. True happiness does not exist outside oneself, you have to find it within. From the practices of mindfulness, compassion and meditation, a road will open up to happiness. This happiness is renewable, it is under your control and power.

Andy Rooney says it best:

“For most of life, nothing wonderful happens. If you don’t enjoy getting up and working and finishing your work and sitting down to a meal with family or friends, then the chances are you’re not going to be very happy. If someone bases his/her happiness on major events like a great job, huge amounts of money, a flawlessly happy marriage or a trip to Paris, that person isn’t going to be happy much of the time.

If, on the other hand, happiness depends on a good breakfast, flowers in the yard, a drink or a nap, then we are more likely to live with quite a bit of happiness.”

5) Simplifying Your Life

Changing what we consume mentally and physically can significantly change our mood.

Most of us are too occupied by things like social media, TV, gossip and other

distractions that don’t add value to our life.

Slowly eliminate some of these distractions, or at least limit yourself on how much you spend on these activities. You will find that your life has more purpose, that you’re not comparing yourself to others and it will make finding that mindful state a whole lot easier.

These points may not seem like much but they do lead to significant changes which you will only believe once you experience it for yourself.

"The Zen of Negative Emotions: Why Letting Ourselves Feel Bad Is the Key to Feeling Better

We all can agree that negative emotions can be tough to deal with. Sometimes it can be much easier to avoid them and keep them bottled up inside.

Yet, according to research, one of the main causes of many psychological problems is the habit of emotional avoidance. It appears that avoiding negative emotions buys you a short-term gain at the price of long-term pain.

According to spiritual guru Osho, it’s crucial to experience all emotions if we want to be truly happy:

“Sadness gives depth. Happiness gives height. Sadness gives roots. Happiness gives branches. Happiness is like a tree going into the sky, and sadness is like the roots going down into the womb of the earth. Both are needed, and the higher a tree goes, the deeper it goes, simultaneously. The bigger the tree, the bigger will be its roots. In fact, it is always in proportion. That’s its balance.”

The question is:

How do we learn to embrace our emotions?

Osho believes that’s all about listening to your being and becoming mature:

“Listen to your being. It is continuously giving you hints; it is a still, small voice. It does not shout at you, that is true. And if you are a little silent you will start feeling your way. Be the person you are. Never try to be another, and you will become mature. Maturity is accepting the responsibility of being oneself, whatsoever the cost. Risking all to be oneself, that’s what maturity is all about.”

One strategy to learn to embrace your emotions

Osho also offers a brilliant strategy to embrace difficult emotions like sadness, anxiety and depression:

“Sadness is silent, it is yours. It is coming because you are alone. It is giving you a chance to go deeper into your aloneness. Rather than jumping from one shallow happiness to another shallow happiness and wasting your life, it is better to use sadness as a means for meditation. Witness it. It is a friend! It opens the door of your eternal aloneness.”

Master Buddhust Pema Chödrön also echoes these feelings:

“…feelings like disappointment, embarrassment, irritation, resentment, anger, jealousy, and fear, instead of being bad news, are actually very clear moments that teach us where it is that we’re holding back. They teach us to perk up and lean in when we feel we’d rather collapse and back away. They’re like messengers that show us, with terrifying clarity, exactly where we’re stuck. This very moment is the perfect teacher, and, lucky for us, it’s with us wherever we are.”

By viewing these emotions as friends, you will gradually rewire your brain to accept them and work with them, rather than fighting against them.

For example, when you experience anxiety, you can see it as an overprotective friend that is just looking out for you. You can simply say, “Thanks for looking out for me, even if you’re being a bit silly.”

Osho also offers a brilliant strategy to embrace difficult emotions like sadness, anxiety and depression:

“Sadness is silent, it is yours. It is coming because you are alone. It is giving you a chance to go deeper into your aloneness. Rather than jumping from one shallow happiness to another shallow happiness and wasting your life, it is better to use sadness as a means for meditation. Witness it. It is a friend! It opens the door of your eternal aloneness.”

Master Buddhust Pema Chödrön also echoes these feelings:

“…feelings like disappointment, embarrassment, irritation, resentment, anger, jealousy, and fear, instead of being bad news, are actually very clear moments that teach us where it is that we’re holding back. They teach us to perk up and lean in when we feel we’d rather collapse and back away. They’re like messengers that show us, with terrifying clarity, exactly where we’re stuck. This very moment is the perfect teacher, and, lucky for us, it’s with us wherever we are.”

By viewing these emotions as friends, you will gradually rewire your brain to accept them and work with them, rather than fighting against them.

For example, when you experience anxiety, you can see it as an overprotective friend that is just looking out for you. You can simply say, “Thanks for looking out for me, even if you’re being a bit silly.”

"Former KKK Leader Reveals How ‘One Old Black Man Defeated The Entire Klu Klux Klan’

When hurt by someone all of us find it hard to forgive, forget and move forward. The thought of making a positive change in the life of the person who has hurt you would be the farthest from our minds. The story of Reverend Wade Watts is one that shows us the power of forgiveness and how the results of forgiveness cannot only change your attacker but the entire world.

‘Rev. Watts was like a father to me. I am grateful for all the years I had with him, and for all the wisdom and knowledge he passed on to me. He told me that he was passing me his mantle. I do not feel worthy to take it up; however, if he thought that much of me to invest all those years of time and wisdom into me, then I owe it to the memory of him to fight racism and continue his works. Wade and I always called one another “Old Partner”. I will miss him for the rest of my life, and will never forget him.”

–Johnny Lee Clary

Rev. Wade Watts passed away, Dec. 13th, 1998. The night he passed away, two of his daughters heard him talking as he laid in bed. They heard Wade say “Thank You, Sir!” They asked him, ” Dad, who are you talking to?”, since they were the only ones in the room with him. Wade replied, ” I am talking to Jesus. He said He is coming to take me home.”

"Facebook’s Best Feature Just Disappeared :'(

by

(ANTIMEDIA) Facebook has been under fire for quite some time. From its controversial algorithms that segregate people according to their political ideologies to their collusionwith government intelligence agencies and corrupt mainstream media organizations, the behemoth social media platform is repeatedly the target of widespread criticism from many corners of the internet.

But Facebook recently did something positive. For Mother’s Day this year and last year, they added a special reaction emoji to their list of selections: in addition to love, like, “wow,” “haha,” sad, and angry reaction options, they added a flower. The flower stood for being thankful.

For several days, Facebook users were able to express gratitude for posts they liked by selecting an aesthetically pleasing purple blossom to react to posts. Unfortunately, however, just as they did last year, Facebook removed the option just days after the holiday passed (fun fact: one of the earliest intentions of Mother’s Day was to protest war).

Many Americans and Facebook users around the world are well aware of the abyss of negativity the platform fosters. Individuals spout off angry opinions into a cacophony of other enraged perspectives, screaming at each other, insulting each other, and often wishing terrible things upon strangers they’ve never met and never will meet. Though it’s not Facebook’s fault that humanity is in turmoil, their own algorithmic behavior and, consequently, contributions to societal divides are undeniable.

That’s why the thankful flower was so important, and why it’s a mistake for the platform to make it disappear. Gratitude is one of the most effective emotions and practices for cultivating happiness and well-being, as well as relating to others, and this has been demonstrated in many instances.

Though being grateful is usually relegated to the Thanksgiving holiday and yoga and meditation practices, even mainstream business-oriented outlet Forbes has documented the myriad benefits of taking time to be appreciative. In 2014, psychotherapist Amy Morin wrote an article for the outlet listing a variety of benefits that come with practicing gratitude: it has been to linked improved psychological and physical health, increased likelihood of creating ongoing relationships, increased empathy and decreased aggression, enhanced sleep, and higher self-esteem.

World-renowned yoga teacher Bryan Kest, who teaches at his donation-based studio in Santa Monica, almost always closes his 90-minute power vinyasa classes with a meditation on gratitude. As he opens the meditation, he guides his students to focus on the “trillions of reasons” they have to be thankful. Whether it’s having food to eat, a warm bed to sleep in, family, friends, pets, access to nature, or a closet full of clothes — or one of many other reasons he offers his students to ponder — this meditation is wildly popular among those who frequent the studio. This is likely because gratitude is vital to cultivating happiness.

In 2015, a Harvard blog post detailed one study on gratitude:

“After 10 weeks, those who wrote about being grateful were more optimistic and felt better about their lives. Surprisingly, they had also exercised more and had fewer visits to physicians than those who focused on sources of aggravation.”

As Facebook continues to be an echo chamber for outrage and venomous interactions, it appears we will have to take it upon ourselves to foster gratitude as the purple flower disappears until next year. One effective way to do so is to make a daily list every evening noting five things you were grateful for throughout the day (or came to be upon making the list). These things can be as simple as having clean water to drink or seeing someone you care about.

Another way to help foster gratitude is to sign up for a free seven-day membership with Bryan Kest’s online archive to access his highly powerful guided meditation (it is part of a long three-part meditation, and monthly membership rates are reasonable and include a vast variety of yoga classes from multiple teachers). Additionally, Insight Timer is a free meditation app that includes several meditations on gratitude, as well as many other helpful guided practices to cultivate well-being and happiness. There are also countless gratitude meditations on Youtube. They vary, so if you find one you don’t connect with, try another!

Just as we cannot expect Facebook to be an arbiter of unbiased truth or fair exposure to independent media, we also cannot expect it to give us ample means to express positive emotions. Luckily, we all have that power within ourselves if we simply step away from our computer screens in favor of getting in touch with practices that can actually help ourselves and our fellow humans — rather than continuing to tumble down the social media abyss at the expense of our own peace of mind.

"From Collective Evolution

“There are great ideas undiscovered, breakthroughs available to those who can remove one of truth’s protective layers. There are places to go beyond belief” – Neil Armstrong (source)

It wasn’t long ago that the Russian government called for an international investigation into the U.S. moon landings regarding missing samples and photos not released to the public. This created a new wave of interest into what really happened when the U.S. went up there, and led some to question if they even went there at all. The topic is filled with a number of interesting facts and statements from credible people that make one thing abundantly clear: Something fishy is happening on the moon, and we’re not being told about it.

This uncertainty has been made apparent by various sources, which include multiple Apollo astronauts, academicians, and high ranking military whistleblowers, not to mention official photos taken by NASA. According to Bob Dean, an United States Army Command Sergeant Major who also served at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) of NATO as an intelligence analyst, more footage exists, erased and hidden all these years, which we have never been told about:

Ladies and gentlemen, my government, NASA, which many of us in the United States say stands for Never A Straight Answer, proceeded to erase 40 rolls of film of the Apollo Program — the flight to the Moon, the flight around the Moon, the landings on the Moon, the walking guys here and there. They erased, for Christ’s sake, 40 rolls of film of those events. Now we’re talking about several thousand individual frames that were taken that the so-called authorities determined that you did not have a right to see. Oh, they were ‘disruptive,’ ‘socially unacceptable,’ ‘politically unacceptable.’ I’ve become furious. I’m a retired Command Sergeant Major. I was never famous for having a lot of patience. (source)

We will get into more intriguing facts from sources that would be considered credible later in the article. More points will be made as to why so many people are starting to wonder if there is actually, or was, an alien presence on the moon. These points make it easier to consider the lore that surrounds the moon landing. Perhaps one of the most interesting is what Neil Armstrong communicated to Houston when we landed on the moon.

According to multiple sources, after landing, the Apollo astronauts transmitted that they were being watched by very large extraterrestrial vehicles.

One source is Dr. Steven Greer, founder of The Disclosure Project and The Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI). Greer was responsible for bringing forth high level military whistleblowers from all ranks to testify about the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon. He’s also had high level meetings within the Pentagon about this issue, which was verified by Apollo 14 astronaut and 6th man to walk on the moon, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, in Greer’s film Sirius Disclosure.

Edgar is one of multiple NASA astronauts who have made some eye-opening comments about the extraterrestrial presence.

According to Greer, from a blog post a couple years ago: If this link doesn’t work, you can check out a video of him speaking about the experience here.

Close friends and very close family members of both Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have separately told me that indeed there were numerous, large UFOs around the crater where the Lunar Module landed and that these were seen by both Armstrong and Aldrin. I have also spoken to military officers that have seen the footage of this event- but it has never been made public. One close family member of Buzz Aldrin told me “It is not my place to out Buzz on this- someday if he can speak about it, he will…

Neil Armstrong became somewhat of a recluse after the moon landing, and rarely spoke of the historic event. His friends and family have told me that this is because he was a man of such integrity that he simply did not want to be put in a position to lie to the public about such a momentous encounter. How tragic that our heroes have been placed in this untenable situation!

When we were organizing The Disclosure Project a few years ago, I asked one of Neil Armstrong’s friends if Armstrong would come to Washington to brief members of Congress at the 1997 Congressional briefing we organized in April of that year. I was told that Armstrong wished he could –but that if he spoke about what really happened during the moon landing, that Neil Armstrong, his wife, and children would all be killed. It was put to me this bluntly. (additional source)

Another source is a former NASA employee, Ken Johnston. Johnston was a Boeing engineer and a former fighter-jock and test pilot for Grumman Aerospace. He was also a marine and an F-4 pilot, as well as a NASA employee, working as the chief Lunar Module test pilot at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. According to James Oberg, a U.S. space journalist, UFO skeptic, and space historian, “Johnston seems to be a sweet human being who did honorable service to his country in the military and in the Apollo program.”

Above is a picture of him wearing his gear, taken from a documentary in which he appeared that also featured Buzz Aldrin and other notable NASA colleagues. In the documentary, he reveals: “While Neil and Buzz were on the Lunar surface, Neil switched to the medical channel, and spoke directly with the chief medical officer saying, they’re here, they’re parked on the side of the crater, they’re watching us.” (Source: 34 second mark)

Johnston is referring to a story put out by former NASA employee Otto Bender. According to Dr. Michael Salla, PhD., on a post written on his website, Bender confirmed that HAM radio operators had intercepted these VHF signals that were transmitted from Apollo 11, the ones that were kept from the public.

Apparently, this is how it went:

Mission Control: What’s there ? Mission Control calling Apollo 11.

Apollo 11: These babies are huge, sir … enormous….Oh, God, you wouldn’t believe it! I’m telling you there are other space craft out there… lined up on the far side of the crater edge… they’re on the moon watching us. (source)

To the right you will see a picture of William Tompkins and Admiral Larry Marsh. As a teenager Tompkins had an eye for detail and loved to create Navy ship and submarine models. The Navy took interest in his capabilities and recruited him to do work on advanced technology projects. Recently, he has come forward with claims, as many others have, about clandestine Black Budget operation programs.

According to Tompkins:

The Landing Module (LEM) actually impacted the Moon surface in the Sea of Tranquility Crater, which had tremendous size vehicles parked around part of its rim. When astronaut Neil Armstrong made that First Step for Man on the Moon he looked up to the edge of the crater and said to mission control: “There are other ships here, they are enormous. The public did not hear that statement or see the massive alien starships. Armstrong panned his camera in a 360 degree motional all around the crater and the CIA then classified the information as way above top secret. (source)

Another source for this story comes from Timothy Good, one of the world’s leading UFO researchers, who has lectured at universities, schools, and many organizations, including the Institute of Medical Laboratory Sciences, the Royal Canadian Military Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Naval Air Reserve Branch, the House of Lords All-Party UFO Study Group, and the Oxford and Cambridge Union societies.

He says that a former member of MI6 revealed her conversation with Neil Armstrong at a NASA conference, when he confirmed that there were “other” spacecraft on the Moon when Apollo 11 landed in 1969. Armstrong also confirmed that the CIA was behind the coverup. He also goes into more detail about it in this interesting lecture from 2013.

So you see, this story has many different sides to it, and given all of the information that’s now available in the public domain regarding UFOs and extraterrestrial life, it’s really not hard to believe, especially when we already have some compelling information about the moon.

Why The Above Story Could Very Well Be True

Maurice Chatelain, whose expertise allowed him to invent radio equipment used to go to the moon (here is an example of one of his twelve patents), has revealed that, “at no time when the astronauts were in space were they alone. They were under constant surveillance by UFOs.”

This statement has been packed up by several astronauts, one of them being Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the 6th man to walk on the moon:

“Yes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered. . . . We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time. I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real.” (source) (source) (source)

It’s not only agency astronauts, but agency insiders as well. For example, Dr. John Brandenburg, the Deputy Manager of the Clementine Mission to the Moon, which was part of a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defence Organization (BMDO) and NASA, has also made some fascinating revelations. The mission discovered water at the Moon’s poles in 1994. (Source: page 16 of 18)(source)(source) But, according to Brandenburg, the Clementine Mission had an ulterior agenda:

[The Clementine Mission was] a photo reconnaissance mission basically to check out if someone was building bases on the moon that we didn’t know about. Were they expanding they expanding them? . . . Of all the pictures I’ve seen from the moon that show possible structures, the most impressive is a picture of a miles wide recto-linear structure. This looked unmistakably artificial, and it shouldn’t be there. As somebody in the space defence community, I look on any such structure on the moon with great concern because it isn’t ours, there’s no way we could have built such a thing. It means someone else is up there. (source)

George Leonard, a NASA scientist and photo analyst, has obtained a number of official NASA photographs of the Moon which he published in his book Somebody Else Is On The Moon. Although the photos are small in size and their resolution is not up to today’s standards, they show details of original, massive prints. Far more compelling than these photos, then, are his verified NASA credentials and his statements about what was found on the Moon. And he’s not the only one with a credible background trying to tell the world the truth about the Moon and the photos that were taken from the Apollo missions.

Dr. Norman Bergrun, a mechanical engineer who worked for Ames Research Laboratory, NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics), and Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, now known as Lockheed Martin, has accused the agency of “garbling” photos that the agency does not want the public to see. He has also stated that there are a number of large UFOs out there. You can view some of his publications for NASA, where he worked for more than a decade, here, and watch that interview here.

There are also studies to consider. Members of the Society For Planetary SETI Research (SPSR) have recently published a paper in the Journal of Space Exploration about certain features on the far side of the moon that appear in the crater Paracelsus C. Titled “Image Analysis of Unusual Structures on the Far Side of the Moon in the Crater Paracelsus C,” it argues that these features might be artificial in origin, meaning someone other than a human being built them and put them there. You can read more about that here.

“Shortly after I retired from the Air-Force, and I still was maintaining contacts with friends and associates at the various bases and one Col Parker in the Air Defence Command, the Space Command . . . mentioned an incident which I later confirmed. A spacecraft went to the rescue of Apollo 13, and they accompanied Apollo 13 on their voyage around the moon and back to Earth, and on two occasions they thought they might have to transfer the crew to their spacecraft. But they saw them safely back to the Earth.”

The quote above comes from Colonel Ross Dedrickson, who, in the 1950s, was responsible for maintaining the inventory of the nuclear weapon stockpile for the AEC and accompanying security teams checking out the security of the weapons, among many other duties throughout his career. It was taken from the interview below.

He is one of the hundreds of military whistleblowers to give some very interesting testimony:"

Another source for this story comes from Timothy Good, one of the world’s leading UFO researchers, who has lectured at universities, schools, and many organizations, including the Institute of Medical Laboratory Sciences, the Royal Canadian Military Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Naval Air Reserve Branch, the House of Lords All-Party UFO Study Group, and the Oxford and Cambridge Union societies.

He says that a former member of MI6 revealed her conversation with Neil Armstrong at a NASA conference, when he confirmed that there were “other” spacecraft on the Moon when Apollo 11 landed in 1969. Armstrong also confirmed that the CIA was behind the coverup. He also goes into more detail about it in this interesting lecture from 2013.

So you see, this story has many different sides to it, and given all of the information that’s now available in the public domain regarding UFOs and extraterrestrial life, it’s really not hard to believe, especially when we already have some compelling information about the moon.

Why The Above Story Could Very Well Be True

Maurice Chatelain, whose expertise allowed him to invent radio equipment used to go to the moon (here is an example of one of his twelve patents), has revealed that, “at no time when the astronauts were in space were they alone. They were under constant surveillance by UFOs.”

This statement has been packed up by several astronauts, one of them being Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the 6th man to walk on the moon:

“Yes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered. . . . We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time. I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real.” (source) (source) (source)

It’s not only agency astronauts, but agency insiders as well. For example, Dr. John Brandenburg, the Deputy Manager of the Clementine Mission to the Moon, which was part of a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defence Organization (BMDO) and NASA, has also made some fascinating revelations. The mission discovered water at the Moon’s poles in 1994. (Source: page 16 of 18)(source)(source) But, according to Brandenburg, the Clementine Mission had an ulterior agenda:

[The Clementine Mission was] a photo reconnaissance mission basically to check out if someone was building bases on the moon that we didn’t know about. Were they expanding they expanding them? . . . Of all the pictures I’ve seen from the moon that show possible structures, the most impressive is a picture of a miles wide recto-linear structure. This looked unmistakably artificial, and it shouldn’t be there. As somebody in the space defence community, I look on any such structure on the moon with great concern because it isn’t ours, there’s no way we could have built such a thing. It means someone else is up there. (source)

George Leonard, a NASA scientist and photo analyst, has obtained a number of official NASA photographs of the Moon which he published in his book Somebody Else Is On The Moon. Although the photos are small in size and their resolution is not up to today’s standards, they show details of original, massive prints. Far more compelling than these photos, then, are his verified NASA credentials and his statements about what was found on the Moon. And he’s not the only one with a credible background trying to tell the world the truth about the Moon and the photos that were taken from the Apollo missions.

Dr. Norman Bergrun, a mechanical engineer who worked for Ames Research Laboratory, NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics), and Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, now known as Lockheed Martin, has accused the agency of “garbling” photos that the agency does not want the public to see. He has also stated that there are a number of large UFOs out there. You can view some of his publications for NASA, where he worked for more than a decade, here, and watch that interview here.

There are also studies to consider. Members of the Society For Planetary SETI Research (SPSR) have recently published a paper in the Journal of Space Exploration about certain features on the far side of the moon that appear in the crater Paracelsus C. Titled “Image Analysis of Unusual Structures on the Far Side of the Moon in the Crater Paracelsus C,” it argues that these features might be artificial in origin, meaning someone other than a human being built them and put them there. You can read more about that here.

“Shortly after I retired from the Air-Force, and I still was maintaining contacts with friends and associates at the various bases and one Col Parker in the Air Defence Command, the Space Command . . . mentioned an incident which I later confirmed. A spacecraft went to the rescue of Apollo 13, and they accompanied Apollo 13 on their voyage around the moon and back to Earth, and on two occasions they thought they might have to transfer the crew to their spacecraft. But they saw them safely back to the Earth.”

The quote above comes from Colonel Ross Dedrickson, who, in the 1950s, was responsible for maintaining the inventory of the nuclear weapon stockpile for the AEC and accompanying security teams checking out the security of the weapons, among many other duties throughout his career. It was taken from the interview below.

"If We Want To Avoid Becoming The Next ‘Lost’ Civilization We Need To Listen To This Warning

Graham Hancock is a British writer and journalist. Hancock specialises in unconventional theories involving ancient civilisations, stone monuments or megaliths, altered states of consciousness, ancient myths and astronomical/astrological data from the past. One of the main themes running through many of his books is a posited global connection with a “mother culture” from which he believes all ancient historical civilisations sprang.

I personally believe in 100 years time he will be remembered as someone who was on the right side of truth and if we do manage to survive as a civilisation for that long and do it sustainably he will certainly have played a huge role in that journey to save humanity.

I was recently writing an article for Spirit Science which featured a lengthy interview with Graham what he said at the tail end of the video really impacted me. It’s a powerful message of truth that will wake people up and also one of hope that should remind us how to move forward as a human race.

For those who wish to read what he said here is the transcript:

”I’d like to say just one more thing. Which is that Plato’s story of Atlantis has a lesson for us I think. The story of Atlantis is that it was once this great and wise civilisation, very generous and kind and supportive and deeply spiritual but as time went by it became puffed up with arrogance and pride, it became cruel, it started to project it’s power around the world and to shape the destiny’s of other Peoples in a very negative way and became so confident of it’s own power that it was utterly unprepared for the cataclysm when it came. And I can’t help feeling that we tick all the boxes of the next lost civilisation because that the kind of civilisation that we are today, we are arrogant, over sure or ourselves , projecting our power around the world totally focussed on material things ignoring the realm of spirit entirely , living only in the moment with only short-term economic gains being our entire focus and this is not the right way to live. This is philosophically and spiritually wrong that we’re living in this way and the lesson of history is – we need to learn humility, we need to learn to bear our prosperity with moderation, and that’s what Plato said about Atlantis, that they failed to bear their prosperity with moderation and that this cost them very dear.

We’re probably the first civilisation in the whole story of human history who have the capacity to intervene in our cosmic environment. We actually could make our cosmic environment safe. It’s not a gloom and doom story . We can make it safe. We need not become the next lost civilisation but while our eye is on all the hatred and fear and suspicion that are generated in the world today, while we are spending trillions of dollars on sophisticated weapons of destruction to wipe one another out and murder one another in horrific manners we are not attending to the real threat of the future of humanity. And if we were to make this a grand human project, collectively to get together to make the cosmic environment of earth safe we could absolutely do it. The choice is in our hands.”

I think Graham’s message is both powerful and truthful beyond measure and it’s up to us to spread it and to save the future of humanity. We must harness the power of social media and the internet to keep the masses informed and focussed on helping society progress in the best way possible.

Graham Hancock is the widely read author of “Magicians of the Gods,” “Fingerprints of the Gods,” “The Message of the Sphinx,” “Underworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization,” and the “War God” series.

"Top 10 Psychology Hacks You Can Use To Control Situations

The human brain is a mysterious thing that can be affected by things in unexpected ways. Every day we are subtly influenced by things we aren’t even aware of. That is why I’m petty glad I came across this video on YouTube which contains 10 examples that demonstrate how you can use knowledge of certain psychological principles to gain control of situations and use them to your advantage be it socially, professionally or academically.

So to summarize here are those 10 psychology hacks in short:

Throw them off their game – If you’re playing a sport, or a game, and your opponent is doing spectacularly, there’s a way to throw them off without them even realizing it. Ask them about their technique.

Don’t over-negotiate – Negotiating deals is a mixture of art and science that some people seem to excel at and others just stumble through.

Eye Contact – Figuring out just how much eye contact you’re supposed to make in a conversation can be awkward, especially for the sorts of people who might not be huge fans of having conversations with people they don’t know in the first place.

Remember names – Whenever you meet someone that you’ll meet again, or even if there’s just a chance that you’ll meet them again, it’s important to remember their name.

Chew gum for tests – Provided that your loud chewing noises don’t cause your classmates to physically attack you, scientists have discovered that chewing gum right before a test could improve your score.

Foot in the door – This infamous psychological marketing method, known as the ‘foot in the door’ technique, operates on the principle that people are more likely to agree to something big if you can first get them to agree to something small.

Asking questions – Talking to other human beings can be difficult for some human beings. It can seem like a daunting task, and it can be almost physically painful to sit through an awkward silence.

First dates – While many people may think that the ideal place for a first date is a movie theater or a coffee shop, science may suggest that you would be better off taking your date on a roller coaster. Smiling –

Smiling, it turns out, can be a powerful psychological tool.

“Because” – At a library, researchers cut in front of people who were in line to use a photocopy machine. Not because they were really busy, but for science.

"Elon Musk: Tesla’s Solar Roofs Will Be Cheaper Than Regular Roofs & Have “Infinity Warranty”

A NOTABLE ANNOUNCEMENT

Recently, Elon Musk announced via Twitter that orders would begin today (May 10th, 2017) for his revolutionary solar roof hardware. In another tweet, he promised that ordering would be available in most countries throughout the world. He also clarified that people could expect to see delivery begin in the United States in late 2017, and that deliveries would roll out sometime next year for overseas locations.

But another announcement just came in that’s even more revolutionary: The solar roofs will have an infinity warranty.

Yes, you read that right. The Tesla website just released all the information that you will need regarding how to order their new solar roof tiles and, remarkably, the site states that the tiles are guaranteed literally forever: “Glass solar tiles are so durable they are warrantied for the lifetime of your house, or infinity, whichever comes first.”

Ultimately, this absurd warranty lends authority to Musk’s previous claims that the solar roofs would be cheaper than traditional roofs, which is notable because cost efficiency is one of the primary hurdles when it comes to renewable energy.

The website also clarifies that other energy solutions could be used alongside the solar roofs to help decrease energy bills and allow individuals to truly go “off the grid.” As the site outlines, “With an integrated Powerwall battery, energy collected during the day is stored and made available any time, effectively turning your home into a personal utility.”

Everything we know about Tesla’s Solar Roof(Video)

A NEW AGE IN ENERGY

In the end, disruptions like these are precisely why Tesla acquired SolarCity in November of 2016. Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity allows for a completely integrated home energy experience — all housed under one company. And the revolution that Tesla is leading is remarkably promising. As we previously reported, studies by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and others suggest that 25 percent of the United States’ energy needs could be filled by rooftop solar installations alone.

Of course, not every rooftop is ideal for solar paneling, and a combination of many factors determine how much electricity any given rooftop can generate. These factors include average sunlight of the area, as well as how much of that sunlight is allowed to reach the roof, uninhibited by pesky tall buildings, trees, or other shade-throwing structures.

To that end, Tesla allows you to take a look at your cost vs. savings. If you live in the United States, you can use get an estimate based on data obtained from Google’s Sunroof project.

"From Collective Evolution

“There are great ideas undiscovered, breakthroughs available to those who can remove one of truth’s protective layers. There are places to go beyond belief” – Neil Armstrong (source)

It wasn’t long ago that the Russian government called for an international investigation into the U.S. moon landings regarding missing samples and photos not released to the public. This created a new wave of interest into what really happened when the U.S. went up there, and led some to question if they even went there at all. The topic is filled with a number of interesting facts and statements from credible people that make one thing abundantly clear: Something fishy is happening on the moon, and we’re not being told about it.

This uncertainty has been made apparent by various sources, which include multiple Apollo astronauts, academicians, and high ranking military whistleblowers, not to mention official photos taken by NASA. According to Bob Dean, an United States Army Command Sergeant Major who also served at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) of NATO as an intelligence analyst, more footage exists, erased and hidden all these years, which we have never been told about:

Ladies and gentlemen, my government, NASA, which many of us in the United States say stands for Never A Straight Answer, proceeded to erase 40 rolls of film of the Apollo Program — the flight to the Moon, the flight around the Moon, the landings on the Moon, the walking guys here and there. They erased, for Christ’s sake, 40 rolls of film of those events. Now we’re talking about several thousand individual frames that were taken that the so-called authorities determined that you did not have a right to see. Oh, they were ‘disruptive,’ ‘socially unacceptable,’ ‘politically unacceptable.’ I’ve become furious. I’m a retired Command Sergeant Major. I was never famous for having a lot of patience. (source)

We will get into more intriguing facts from sources that would be considered credible later in the article. More points will be made as to why so many people are starting to wonder if there is actually, or was, an alien presence on the moon. These points make it easier to consider the lore that surrounds the moon landing. Perhaps one of the most interesting is what Neil Armstrong communicated to Houston when we landed on the moon.

According to multiple sources, after landing, the Apollo astronauts transmitted that they were being watched by very large extraterrestrial vehicles.

One source is Dr. Steven Greer, founder of The Disclosure Project and The Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI). Greer was responsible for bringing forth high level military whistleblowers from all ranks to testify about the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon. He’s also had high level meetings within the Pentagon about this issue, which was verified by Apollo 14 astronaut and 6th man to walk on the moon, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, in Greer’s film Sirius Disclosure.

Edgar is one of multiple NASA astronauts who have made some eye-opening comments about the extraterrestrial presence.

According to Greer, from a blog post a couple years ago: If this link doesn’t work, you can check out a video of him speaking about the experience here.

Close friends and very close family members of both Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have separately told me that indeed there were numerous, large UFOs around the crater where the Lunar Module landed and that these were seen by both Armstrong and Aldrin. I have also spoken to military officers that have seen the footage of this event- but it has never been made public. One close family member of Buzz Aldrin told me “It is not my place to out Buzz on this- someday if he can speak about it, he will…

Neil Armstrong became somewhat of a recluse after the moon landing, and rarely spoke of the historic event. His friends and family have told me that this is because he was a man of such integrity that he simply did not want to be put in a position to lie to the public about such a momentous encounter. How tragic that our heroes have been placed in this untenable situation!

When we were organizing The Disclosure Project a few years ago, I asked one of Neil Armstrong’s friends if Armstrong would come to Washington to brief members of Congress at the 1997 Congressional briefing we organized in April of that year. I was told that Armstrong wished he could –but that if he spoke about what really happened during the moon landing, that Neil Armstrong, his wife, and children would all be killed. It was put to me this bluntly. (additional source)

Another source is a former NASA employee, Ken Johnston. Johnston was a Boeing engineer and a former fighter-jock and test pilot for Grumman Aerospace. He was also a marine and an F-4 pilot, as well as a NASA employee, working as the chief Lunar Module test pilot at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. According to James Oberg, a U.S. space journalist, UFO skeptic, and space historian, “Johnston seems to be a sweet human being who did honorable service to his country in the military and in the Apollo program.”

Above is a picture of him wearing his gear, taken from a documentary in which he appeared that also featured Buzz Aldrin and other notable NASA colleagues. In the documentary, he reveals: “While Neil and Buzz were on the Lunar surface, Neil switched to the medical channel, and spoke directly with the chief medical officer saying, they’re here, they’re parked on the side of the crater, they’re watching us.” (Source: 34 second mark)

Johnston is referring to a story put out by former NASA employee Otto Bender. According to Dr. Michael Salla, PhD., on a post written on his website, Bender confirmed that HAM radio operators had intercepted these VHF signals that were transmitted from Apollo 11, the ones that were kept from the public.

Apparently, this is how it went:

Mission Control: What’s there ? Mission Control calling Apollo 11.

Apollo 11: These babies are huge, sir … enormous….Oh, God, you wouldn’t believe it! I’m telling you there are other space craft out there… lined up on the far side of the crater edge… they’re on the moon watching us. (source)

To the right you will see a picture of William Tompkins and Admiral Larry Marsh. As a teenager Tompkins had an eye for detail and loved to create Navy ship and submarine models. The Navy took interest in his capabilities and recruited him to do work on advanced technology projects. Recently, he has come forward with claims, as many others have, about clandestine Black Budget operation programs.

According to Tompkins:

The Landing Module (LEM) actually impacted the Moon surface in the Sea of Tranquility Crater, which had tremendous size vehicles parked around part of its rim. When astronaut Neil Armstrong made that First Step for Man on the Moon he looked up to the edge of the crater and said to mission control: “There are other ships here, they are enormous. The public did not hear that statement or see the massive alien starships. Armstrong panned his camera in a 360 degree motional all around the crater and the CIA then classified the information as way above top secret. (source)

Another source for this story comes from Timothy Good, one of the world’s leading UFO researchers, who has lectured at universities, schools, and many organizations, including the Institute of Medical Laboratory Sciences, the Royal Canadian Military Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Naval Air Reserve Branch, the House of Lords All-Party UFO Study Group, and the Oxford and Cambridge Union societies.

He says that a former member of MI6 revealed her conversation with Neil Armstrong at a NASA conference, when he confirmed that there were “other” spacecraft on the Moon when Apollo 11 landed in 1969. Armstrong also confirmed that the CIA was behind the coverup. He also goes into more detail about it in this interesting lecture from 2013.

So you see, this story has many different sides to it, and given all of the information that’s now available in the public domain regarding UFOs and extraterrestrial life, it’s really not hard to believe, especially when we already have some compelling information about the moon.

Why The Above Story Could Very Well Be True

Maurice Chatelain, whose expertise allowed him to invent radio equipment used to go to the moon (here is an example of one of his twelve patents), has revealed that, “at no time when the astronauts were in space were they alone. They were under constant surveillance by UFOs.”

This statement has been packed up by several astronauts, one of them being Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the 6th man to walk on the moon:

“Yes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered. . . . We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time. I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real.” (source) (source) (source)

It’s not only agency astronauts, but agency insiders as well. For example, Dr. John Brandenburg, the Deputy Manager of the Clementine Mission to the Moon, which was part of a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defence Organization (BMDO) and NASA, has also made some fascinating revelations. The mission discovered water at the Moon’s poles in 1994. (Source: page 16 of 18)(source)(source) But, according to Brandenburg, the Clementine Mission had an ulterior agenda:

Of all the pictures I’ve seen from the moon that show possible structures, the most impressive is a picture of a miles wide recto-linear structure. This looked unmistakably artificial, and it shouldn’t be there. As somebody in the space defence community, I look on any such structure on the moon with great concern because it isn’t ours, there’s no way we could have built such a thing. It means someone else is up there. (source)

George Leonard, a NASA scientist and photo analyst, has obtained a number of official NASA photographs of the Moon which he published in his book Somebody Else Is On The Moon. Although the photos are small in size and their resolution is not up to today’s standards, they show details of original, massive prints. Far more compelling than these photos, then, are his verified NASA credentials and his statements about what was found on the Moon. And he’s not the only one with a credible background trying to tell the world the truth about the Moon and the photos that were taken from the Apollo missions.

Dr. Norman Bergrun, a mechanical engineer who worked for Ames Research Laboratory, NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics), and Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, now known as Lockheed Martin, has accused the agency of “garbling” photos that the agency does not want the public to see. He has also stated that there are a number of large UFOs out there. You can view some of his publications for NASA, where he worked for more than a decade, here, and watch that interview here.

There are also studies to consider. Members of the Society For Planetary SETI Research (SPSR) have recently published a paper in the Journal of Space Exploration about certain features on the far side of the moon that appear in the crater Paracelsus C. Titled “Image Analysis of Unusual Structures on the Far Side of the Moon in the Crater Paracelsus C,” it argues that these features might be artificial in origin, meaning someone other than a human being built them and put them there. You can read more about that here.

“Shortly after I retired from the Air-Force, and I still was maintaining contacts with friends and associates at the various bases and one Col Parker in the Air Defence Command, the Space Command . . . mentioned an incident which I later confirmed. A spacecraft went to the rescue of Apollo 13, and they accompanied Apollo 13 on their voyage around the moon and back to Earth, and on two occasions they thought they might have to transfer the crew to their spacecraft. But they saw them safely back to the Earth.”

The quote above comes from Colonel Ross Dedrickson, who, in the 1950s, was responsible for maintaining the inventory of the nuclear weapon stockpile for the AEC and accompanying security teams checking out the security of the weapons, among many other duties throughout his career. It was taken from the interview below.

The topic is filled with a number of interesting facts and statements from credible people that make one thing abundantly clear: Something fishy is happening on the moon, and we’re not being told about it.

This uncertainty has been made apparent by various sources, which include multiple Apollo astronauts, academicians, and high ranking military whistleblowers, not to mention official photos taken by NASA. According to Bob Dean, an United States Army Command Sergeant Major who also served at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) of NATO as an intelligence analyst, more footage exists, erased and hidden all these years, which we have never been told about:

Ladies and gentlemen, my government, NASA, which many of us in the United States say stands for Never A Straight Answer, proceeded to erase 40 rolls of film of the Apollo Program — the flight to the Moon, the flight around the Moon, the landings on the Moon, the walking guys here and there. They erased, for Christ’s sake, 40 rolls of film of those events. Now we’re talking about several thousand individual frames that were taken that the so-called authorities determined that you did not have a right to see. Oh, they were ‘disruptive,’ ‘socially unacceptable,’ ‘politically unacceptable.’ I’ve become furious. I’m a retired Command Sergeant Major. I was never famous for having a lot of patience. (source)

We will get into more intriguing facts from sources that would be considered credible later in the article. More points will be made as to why so many people are starting to wonder if there is actually, or was, an alien presence on the moon. These points make it easier to consider the lore that surrounds the moon landing. Perhaps one of the most interesting is what Neil Armstrong communicated to Houston when we landed on the moon.

According to multiple sources, after landing, the Apollo astronauts transmitted that they were being watched by very large extraterrestrial vehicles.

One source is Dr. Steven Greer, founder of The Disclosure Project and The Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI). Greer was responsible for bringing forth high level military whistleblowers from all ranks to testify about the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon. He’s also had high level meetings within the Pentagon about this issue, which was verified by Apollo 14 astronaut and 6th man to walk on the moon, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, in Greer’s film Sirius Disclosure.

Edgar is one of multiple NASA astronauts who have made some eye-opening comments about the extraterrestrial presence.

According to Greer, from a blog post a couple years ago: If this link doesn’t work, you can check out a video of him speaking about the experience here.

Close friends and very close family members of both Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have separately told me that indeed there were numerous, large UFOs around the crater where the Lunar Module landed and that these were seen by both Armstrong and Aldrin. I have also spoken to military officers that have seen the footage of this event- but it has never been made public. One close family member of Buzz Aldrin told me “It is not my place to out Buzz on this- someday if he can speak about it, he will…

Neil Armstrong became somewhat of a recluse after the moon landing, and rarely spoke of the historic event. His friends and family have told me that this is because he was a man of such integrity that he simply did not want to be put in a position to lie to the public about such a momentous encounter. How tragic that our heroes have been placed in this untenable situation!

When we were organizing The Disclosure Project a few years ago, I asked one of Neil Armstrong’s friends if Armstrong would come to Washington to brief members of Congress at the 1997 Congressional briefing we organized in April of that year. I was told that Armstrong wished he could –but that if he spoke about what really happened during the moon landing, that Neil Armstrong, his wife, and children would all be killed. It was put to me this bluntly. (additional source)

Another source is a former NASA employee, Ken Johnston. Johnston was a Boeing engineer and a former fighter-jock and test pilot for Grumman Aerospace. He was also a marine and an F-4 pilot, as well as a NASA employee, working as the chief Lunar Module test pilot at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. According to James Oberg, a U.S. space journalist, UFO skeptic, and space historian, “Johnston seems to be a sweet human being who did honorable service to his country in the military and in the Apollo program.”

Above is a picture of him wearing his gear, taken from a documentary in which he appeared that also featured Buzz Aldrin and other notable NASA colleagues. In the documentary, he reveals: “While Neil and Buzz were on the Lunar surface, Neil switched to the medical channel, and spoke directly with the chief medical officer saying, they’re here, they’re parked on the side of the crater, they’re watching us.” (Source: 34 second mark)

Johnston is referring to a story put out by former NASA employee Otto Bender. According to Dr. Michael Salla, PhD., on a post written on his website, Bender confirmed that HAM radio operators had intercepted these VHF signals that were transmitted from Apollo 11, the ones that were kept from the public.

Apparently, this is how it went:

Mission Control: What’s there ? Mission Control calling Apollo 11.

Apollo 11: These babies are huge, sir … enormous….Oh, God, you wouldn’t believe it! I’m telling you there are other space craft out there… lined up on the far side of the crater edge… they’re on the moon watching us. (source)

To the right you will see a picture of William Tompkins and Admiral Larry Marsh. As a teenager Tompkins had an eye for detail and loved to create Navy ship and submarine models. The Navy took interest in his capabilities and recruited him to do work on advanced technology projects. Recently, he has come forward with claims, as many others have, about clandestine Black Budget operation programs.

According to Tompkins:

The Landing Module (LEM) actually impacted the Moon surface in the Sea of Tranquility Crater, which had tremendous size vehicles parked around part of its rim. When astronaut Neil Armstrong made that First Step for Man on the Moon he looked up to the edge of the crater and said to mission control: “There are other ships here, they are enormous. The public did not hear that statement or see the massive alien starships. Armstrong panned his camera in a 360 degree motional all around the crater and the CIA then classified the information as way above top secret. (source)

Another source for this story comes from Timothy Good, one of the world’s leading UFO researchers, who has lectured at universities, schools, and many organizations, including the Institute of Medical Laboratory Sciences, the Royal Canadian Military Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Naval Air Reserve Branch, the House of Lords All-Party UFO Study Group, and the Oxford and Cambridge Union societies.

He says that a former member of MI6 revealed her conversation with Neil Armstrong at a NASA conference, when he confirmed that there were “other” spacecraft on the Moon when Apollo 11 landed in 1969. Armstrong also confirmed that the CIA was behind the coverup. He also goes into more detail about it in this interesting lecture from 2013.

So you see, this story has many different sides to it, and given all of the information that’s now available in the public domain regarding UFOs and extraterrestrial life, it’s really not hard to believe, especially when we already have some compelling information about the moon.

Why The Above Story Could Very Well Be True

Maurice Chatelain, whose expertise allowed him to invent radio equipment used to go to the moon (here is an example of one of his twelve patents), has revealed that, “at no time when the astronauts were in space were they alone. They were under constant surveillance by UFOs.”

This statement has been packed up by several astronauts, one of them being Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the 6th man to walk on the moon:

“Yes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered. . . . We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time. I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real.” (source) (source) (source)

It’s not only agency astronauts, but agency insiders as well. For example, Dr. John Brandenburg, the Deputy Manager of the Clementine Mission to the Moon, which was part of a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defence Organization (BMDO) and NASA, has also made some fascinating revelations. The mission discovered water at the Moon’s poles in 1994. (Source: page 16 of 18)(source)(source) But, according to Brandenburg, the Clementine Mission had an ulterior agenda:

[The Clementine Mission was] a photo reconnaissance mission basically to check out if someone was building bases on the moon that we didn’t know about. Were they expanding they expanding them? . . . Of all the pictures I’ve seen from the moon that show possible structures, the most impressive is a picture of a miles wide recto-linear structure. This looked unmistakably artificial, and it shouldn’t be there. As somebody in the space defence community, I look on any such structure on the moon with great concern because it isn’t ours, there’s no way we could have built such a thing. It means someone else is up there. (source)

George Leonard, a NASA scientist and photo analyst, has obtained a number of official NASA photographs of the Moon which he published in his book Somebody Else Is On The Moon. Although the photos are small in size and their resolution is not up to today’s standards, they show details of original, massive prints. Far more compelling than these photos, then, are his verified NASA credentials and his statements about what was found on the Moon. And he’s not the only one with a credible background trying to tell the world the truth about the Moon and the photos that were taken from the Apollo missions.

Dr. Norman Bergrun, a mechanical engineer who worked for Ames Research Laboratory, NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics), and Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, now known as Lockheed Martin, has accused the agency of “garbling” photos that the agency does not want the public to see. He has also stated that there are a number of large UFOs out there. You can view some of his publications for NASA, where he worked for more than a decade, here, and watch that interview here.

There are also studies to consider. Members of the Society For Planetary SETI Research (SPSR) have recently published a paper in the Journal of Space Exploration about certain features on the far side of the moon that appear in the crater Paracelsus C. Titled “Image Analysis of Unusual Structures on the Far Side of the Moon in the Crater Paracelsus C,” it argues that these features might be artificial in origin, meaning someone other than a human being built them and put them there. You can read more about that here.

“Shortly after I retired from the Air-Force, and I still was maintaining contacts with friends and associates at the various bases and one Col Parker in the Air Defence Command, the Space Command . . . mentioned an incident which I later confirmed. A spacecraft went to the rescue of Apollo 13, and they accompanied Apollo 13 on their voyage around the moon and back to Earth, and on two occasions they thought they might have to transfer the crew to their spacecraft. But they saw them safely back to the Earth.”

The quote above comes from Colonel Ross Dedrickson, who, in the 1950s, was responsible for maintaining the inventory of the nuclear weapon stockpile for the AEC and accompanying security teams checking out the security of the weapons, among many other duties throughout his career. It was taken from the interview below.

He is one of the hundreds of military whistleblowers to give some very interesting testimony:"

"Huge Win For Humanity as Monsanto Loses Millions In 2014 Due To Farmers Abandoning GM Crops

We have great news. Monsanto has suffered a huge blow in the battle for our food supply and our genetic purity. Specifically Monsanto has now lost $156 million in Q4 of 2014 and this comes down to a few different business reasons.

Due to relentless activism Monsanto is being exposed as probably the most corrupt corporation in the world and certainly one of the most hated. Smart investors have realised that Monsanto is tanking and that any association can bring only a negative return on investment.

If the trend of Monsanto losing money continues at this rate then we can all hope to see the GM giant corporation crumble in the near future.

"This Is What Happens When You Treat Mental Illness As Though It Were Physical Illness

Did you know that mental illness affects one in four people today? Despite this terrifying reality, it seems that people take physical diseases much more seriously than mental illnesses.

The reason for this is that we can actually see the wounds or symptoms of physical diseases, while for mental illness the symptoms are elusive at the best of times.

But just because things look fine on the surface doesn’t mean that sufferers of mental illness aren’t going through a significant amount of pain. Keep in mind that mental illness can happen to anyone, no matter how joyful or optimistic they may appear.

One of the most common misconceptions about mental illness is that people who have it lack the willpower to overcome their problems. This is incredibly inconsiderate and counterproductive to the person who is suffering from mental illness.

This misconception is brilliantly shown in this comic below by Robot Hugs.

When you give advice to someone suffering from mental illness based on wrong assumptions, you end up doing more harm than good. Those suffering from mental illness often feel misunderstood, which results in them withdrawing even more and suffering in silence.

Another common misconception about mental illness is that the illness manifests in the same ways for different people. The assumption is that a label makes diagnosis easy and coming up with a solution just a logical process to figure out. Yet very often people with mental illness are high functioning individuals and the condition they’re suffering is incredibly unique. This makes it even more difficult to figure out what is going on.

How you can help

The best way you can help anyone going through mental illness is to take the time to truly understand a person’s challenges without any assumptions or judgments. Make your loved ones feel loved and supported in a compassionate manner.

Professional help is required in many cases, yet the support offered by a family and closed friends is invaluable to the process of recovery even when therapy is involved.

If you or someone you know is experiencing mental illness, we recommend consulting a professional. You can also consider some online resources which we recommend for working on your own personal growth:

"Indian Buddhist Master Explains How to Conquer Negative Thinking in 5 Simple Steps

I think we can all agree that it’s easy to fall prey to negative thinking. As much as we try to follow the advice of staying positive, those negative and worrying thoughts creep in and take hold of our mindset.

There’s a lot of advice about how to combat negative thinking, but I find the most powerful to be the wisdom offered by the Indian Buddhist Master Paramahansa Yogananda.

We distilled his wisdom in 5 easy steps. The wisdom is powerful because it encourages you to face your inner demons rather than run away from them.

It gets better:

By following this advice, you’ll be taking responsibility for your own happiness. Who doesnt want that?

Step 1: Face up to your attachments and release them

“Attachments keep you ever fearful. The more a person’s body-consciousness expands – to include such things as a sense of possessions, a concern for one’s reputation, a sense of personal power or importance – the greater the likelihood of feeling fear. Fearlessness, on the other hand, comes from releasing those attachments: the desire for personal importance; the desire for power or control over anything or anyone; the desire to be well thought of and respected; attachment to possessions; attachment to bodily health and well-being; and, finally, identification of one’s self with the body. Fearlessness comes with perfect non-attachment. It is a natural attitude for those who feel they have nothing to protect.”

Step 2: Break the insidious hold of worrying thoughts

“Shake off your worries by going on ‘worry fasts.’ Go on short worry fasts three times a day to begin with. Take an hour in the morning, an hour at noon, and three hours in the evening. Absolutely refuse to allow a single worry thought to enter your mind during these periods. Then extend the period to a whole day; a week, and then a month. Soon you will have broken the insidious hold of worry thoughts.”

Step 3: Surround yourself with joyful people who laugh a lot

“Associate with joyous persons, for joy and laughter are contagious. There are some people the joy of whose laughter nothing can still. Seek them out, and feast with them on this most vitalizing food of joy. Steadfastly continue your laughter diet, and at the end of a month or two you will see a change – your mind will be filled with sunshine.”

Step 4: Act from the heart

“Fear comes from the heart. If ever you feel overcome by dread of some illness or accident, you should inhale and exhale deeply, slowly, and rhythmically several times, relaxing with each exhalation. This helps the circulation to become normal. If your heart is truly quiet you cannot feel fear at all.”

Step 5: Take control of your own mind

“God has given us one tremendous instrument of protection — more powerful than machine guns, electricity, poison gas, or any medic — the mind. It is the mind that must be strengthened… An important part of the adventure of life is to get hold of the mind, and to keep that controlled mind constantly attuned… This is the secret of a happy, successful existence… It comes by exercising mind power and by attuning the mind to God through meditation.”

"Show Yourself Compassion: 4 Mindful Ways to Stop Negative Self-Talk

We’ve all been confronted by that nagging voice in our heads that makes us feel about two inches tall.

“How could you do something so stupid?”

“You’re never going to be good enough.”

These thoughts can race around in your mind, increasing stress and anxiety in all areas of your life. Luckily, you have the power to put a stop to the vicious cycle of negative self-talk! By showing yourself compassion and releasing your self-judgement, you can silence that nagging voice and build up your self confidence.

These simple strategies will start you on the path to a more positive pattern of self-talk:

1) Become Aware of your Negative Thoughts

Acknowledging negative self-talk removes the power that it has over you. When you find yourself caught up in a web of self-depreciation, consciously stop and examine each thought as it comes through. When you slow down and identify the thought pattern going through your mind, you acknowledge the feeling behind it and can then move forward with releasing it.

2) Swap Negative Self-Talk with Affirmative Statements

“Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.”

This famous quote from Martin Luther King, Jr. forms the foundation for eliminating the pattern of negative self-talk from your life.

Negative thoughts are often part of a vicious cycle in which one thought spawns into another, dragging you down physically and emotionally. By inserting a positive, affirmative statement into your thought pattern you can stop this cycle in its tracks. Make a list of positive statements or affirmations that you can use when your inner critic comes out to play.

3) Understand the Power of your Thoughts

Albert Einstein once said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and expecting different results. The same is true in your thought patterns. When we regularly get drawn into the cycle of negative self-talk, we create a reality based upon those thoughts. By recognizing the triggers to your negative thoughts and consciously replacing them with positive self-talk based on possibilities, you can change the perspective of your entire reality.

4) Release your Negative Thoughts

Often the negative thought patterns we create in our minds feed off each other to make a problem seem much bigger than it is in reality. Release these thoughts by visualizing them in physical form.

An excellent way to do this is by writing a letter to yourself. When you feel caught up in negative emotion, writing it out on paper releases it from the confines of your mind and takes away the power those thoughts have over you. When you are finished with the letter, either burn it or put it away into a “worry box”. Physically releasing thoughts that no longer serve you is a powerful tool to shift the cycle of negative thinking.

There will always be times when our thoughts get stuck in a pattern of negative thinking. Be gentle with yourself, and let go of guilt and self-judgement.

By replacing negative thoughts with positive affirmations and releasing thought patterns that no longer serve you, you will discover that you do have the power within you to rise above the trap of negative self-talk.

"Elon Musk: Tesla’s Solar Roofs Will Be Cheaper Than Regular Roofs & Have “Infinity Warranty”

A NOTABLE ANNOUNCEMENT

Recently, Elon Musk announced via Twitter that orders would begin today (May 10th, 2017) for his revolutionary solar roof hardware. In another tweet, he promised that ordering would be available in most countries throughout the world. He also clarified that people could expect to see delivery begin in the United States in late 2017, and that deliveries would roll out sometime next year for overseas locations.

But another announcement just came in that’s even more revolutionary: The solar roofs will have an infinity warranty.

Yes, you read that right. The Tesla website just released all the information that you will need regarding how to order their new solar roof tiles and, remarkably, the site states that the tiles are guaranteed literally forever: “Glass solar tiles are so durable they are warrantied for the lifetime of your house, or infinity, whichever comes first.”

Ultimately, this absurd warranty lends authority to Musk’s previous claims that the solar roofs would be cheaper than traditional roofs, which is notable because cost efficiency is one of the primary hurdles when it comes to renewable energy.

The website also clarifies that other energy solutions could be used alongside the solar roofs to help decrease energy bills and allow individuals to truly go “off the grid.” As the site outlines, “With an integrated Powerwall battery, energy collected during the day is stored and made available any time, effectively turning your home into a personal utility.”

Everything we know about Tesla’s Solar Roof(Video)

A NEW AGE IN ENERGY

In the end, disruptions like these are precisely why Tesla acquired SolarCity in November of 2016. Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity allows for a completely integrated home energy experience — all housed under one company. And the revolution that Tesla is leading is remarkably promising. As we previously reported, studies by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and others suggest that 25 percent of the United States’ energy needs could be filled by rooftop solar installations alone.

Of course, not every rooftop is ideal for solar paneling, and a combination of many factors determine how much electricity any given rooftop can generate. These factors include average sunlight of the area, as well as how much of that sunlight is allowed to reach the roof, uninhibited by pesky tall buildings, trees, or other shade-throwing structures.

To that end, Tesla allows you to take a look at your cost vs. savings. If you live in the United States, you can use get an estimate based on data obtained from Google’s Sunroof project.

"Elon Musk: Tesla’s Solar Roofs Will Be Cheaper Than Regular Roofs & Have “Infinity Warranty”

A NOTABLE ANNOUNCEMENT

Recently, Elon Musk announced via Twitter that orders would begin today (May 10th, 2017) for his revolutionary solar roof hardware. In another tweet, he promised that ordering would be available in most countries throughout the world. He also clarified that people could expect to see delivery begin in the United States in late 2017, and that deliveries would roll out sometime next year for overseas locations.

But another announcement just came in that’s even more revolutionary: The solar roofs will have an infinity warranty.

Yes, you read that right. The Tesla website just released all the information that you will need regarding how to order their new solar roof tiles and, remarkably, the site states that the tiles are guaranteed literally forever: “Glass solar tiles are so durable they are warrantied for the lifetime of your house, or infinity, whichever comes first.”

"Time Lapse Video of the Grand Canyon Captures Rare Phenomenon That Demands To Be Seen.

By Rae Paoletta

What better way to start off your day with a nice, hot cup of existential uncertainty? Forget everything you think you know about yourself or reality, because a gorgeous new video of the Grand Canyon is about to irrevocably fuck you up. In a good way, we think.

The video is part of a project called SKYGLOW, which aims to educate viewers on the dangers of urban light pollution in North America. In collaboration with the International Dark-Sky Association, SKYGLOW’s two-person team has recorded some of the most stunning views of the night sky in recent memory, including a time lapse of the stars over Hawaii and another of radio astronomy observatories around the US. But this new video captures a rare phenomenon that demands to be seen.

“Cold air is trapped in the canyon and topped by a layer of warm air, which in combination with moisture and condensation form the phenomenon referred to as the full cloud inversion,” SKYGLOW photographer Harun Mehmedinovic explained in an email to Gizmodo. “We were extremely lucky to be there to capture it, and it’s a collection of unique footage not found anywhere else.”

Pop on some Enya deep cuts and watch a sea of clouds fill one of the most epic canyons on Earth. Try not to question your reality too hard.

"40,000-Year-Old Bracelet Made by Extinct Human Species Found

By Stephen Morgan

In what is quite an amazing discovery, scientists have confirmed that a bracelet found in Siberia is 40,000 years old. This makes it the oldest piece of jewelry ever discovered, and archeologists have been taken aback by the level of its sophistication.

The bracelet was discovered in a site called the Denisova Cave in Siberia, close to Russia’s border with China and Mongolia. It was found next to the bones of extinct animals, such as the wooly mammoth, and other artifacts dating back 125,000 years.

The cave is named after the Denisovan people — a mysterious species of hominins from the Homo genus, who are genetically different from both Homo sapiens and Neanderthals.

We know that the Denisovans migrated out of Africa sometime after the first wave of Homo erectus, and well before us, Homo sapiens.

The Denisovans were unique in many ways, having branched away from other humanoid ancestors some 1 million years ago. Indeed, the recent discovery of a female Denisovan finger bone and various teeth shows that they had no morphological similarities to either Neanderthals or modern humans.

However, tens of thousands of years later, and prior to becoming extinct, they did coexist with us and the Neanderthals for a period, and skeletal remains of hybrids, and genetic studies confirm that they also mated with our forebears and the Neanderthals.

Strangely, however, DNA evidence also suggests that, at some point, the Denisovans must have interbred with an as yet unknown and undiscovered species of humans beings.

Skeletal remains show that the Denisovans were probably far more robust and powerful than modern humans, and were, until now, assumed to be a more primitive, archaic type of humans than us.

But, the discovery of the bracelet suggests this was far from true. Amazingly, the skill involved in making this adornment shows a level of technique at least 30,000 years ahead of its time.

Until now, scientists had believed that such skills had only evolved among humans in the Neolithic period, which began at about 10,000 BC. Indeed, originally, they believed that the bracelet had somehow become mixed up with materials dating from a later period.

However, experiments have now definitely ruled that out, and they confirm that it could not have been made by homo sapiens or Neanderthals. After 7 years of analysis, the scientists are confident that the piece was made 30,000 years before the beginning of the Stone Age.

The Daily Mail quotes the head of the Museum of History and Culture of the Peoples’ of Siberia and the Far East in the city of Novosibirsk, Dr Anatoly Derevyanko, who said:

“The skills of its creator were perfect. Initially we thought that it was made by Neanderthals or modern humans, but it turned out that the master was Denisovan.”

Mikhail Shunkov, deputy director of the the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography in Novosibirsk, part of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, suggested that the find indicates that the Denisovans were more advanced than Homo sapiens and Neanderthals.

What is incredible is that the craftsman who made the adornment, seems to have used something similar to a modern drill.

The Siberian Times quotes Dr Derevyanko, who wrote in the Russian magazine, Science First Hand, that when they studied the diameters of the bracelet, they found that the rotational speed of the drill must have been quite high, and with minimal fluctuations.

“The ancient master” he said, “was skilled in techniques previously considered not characteristic for the Palaeolithic era, such as easel speed drilling, boring tool type rasp, grinding and polishing with a leather and skins of varying degrees of tanning.”

Held in place by what they believe was a leather strap, the bracelet itself was made from a type of stone called chlorite, which could only have been imported from some 200km (125 miles) away.

The bracelet was very delicate and was probably worn at special occasions by some important person, such as a Denisovan princess.

Shunkov explains;

“All jewellery had a magical meaning for ancient people. Bracelets and neck adornments were to protect people from evil spirits, for instance.”

“But this item, given the complicated technology and “imported” material, obviously belonged to some high ranking person of that society.”

Commenting on its beauty, Anatoly Derevyanko added;

“The bracelet is stunning. In bright sunlight it reflects the sun rays, at night by the fire it casts a deep shade of green.”

The archeologists are reported to have also found a ring made of marble, but they have not yet disclosed any findings about it.

"Former KKK Leader Reveals How ‘One Old Black Man Defeated The Entire Klu Klux Klan’

When hurt by someone all of us find it hard to forgive, forget and move forward. The thought of making a positive change in the life of the person who has hurt you would be the farthest from our minds. The story of Reverend Wade Watts is one that shows us the power of forgiveness and how the results of forgiveness cannot only change your attacker but the entire world.

‘Rev. Watts was like a father to me. I am grateful for all the years I had with him, and for all the wisdom and knowledge he passed on to me. He told me that he was passing me his mantle. I do not feel worthy to take it up; however, if he thought that much of me to invest all those years of time and wisdom into me, then I owe it to the memory of him to fight racism and continue his works. Wade and I always called one another “Old Partner”. I will miss him for the rest of my life, and will never forget him.”

–Johnny Lee Clary

Rev. Wade Watts passed away, Dec. 13th, 1998. The night he passed away, two of his daughters heard him talking as he laid in bed. They heard Wade say “Thank You, Sir!” They asked him, ” Dad, who are you talking to?”, since they were the only ones in the room with him. Wade replied, ” I am talking to Jesus. He said He is coming to take me home.”

"People Who Wear Crazy Socks Are More Creative, Rebellious and Successful

How do you feel about the socks you wear? You probably fall into one of two camps. Either black, blue grey will do, or socks are a way for you to show off your individuality, personality and non-conformed attitudes.

You think this is dramatic or crazy? Well, it turns out that new research demonstrates that novel and crazy socks you choose to wear not only reveal a lot about you, but also how you’re perceived by other people.

So what’s the key point?

By wearing crazy socks, you’ll be perceived to have more authority and will probably end up being more successful.

The Surprising Opportunity to Show Huge Potential

Many of us conform to be part of the pack without realizing it, and this especially shows up in the way we speak, act and dress.

When someone doesn’t conform to the behavior of the tribe, they are seen as strange, weird and a bit crazy and we often end up dismissing the unfamiliar. However, socks are a completely different ball game.

Socks sit at the bottom of our trousers and are unassuming. They are almost secretive.

They’re not the most obvious item of clothing. So it’s an opportunity to show off our individuality to anyone who happens to notice, without being obviously outlandish.

What Your Crazy Socks Say About You

A study published in the Journal of Consumer Research recently investigated the theory that people who are noncomformists are viewed as having higher status and more competent than those who conform to social norms.

What does this have to do with your decision to wear brightly colored or snake printed socks?

The study showed that people who have deliberately chosen to wear wacky socks are seen by others to have increased status and competency.

In other words:

People see those wearing wacky socks as being more brilliant, creative and successful.

“We proposed that, under certain conditions, nonconforming behaviours can be more beneficial to someone than simply trying to fit in. In other words, when it looks deliberate, a person can appear to have a higher status and sense of competency.”

Imagine a corporate business person dressed in a smart and expensive suit, only to have bright red socks under his pants. The boldness of the choice shows him to be outwardly conforming but revealing a rebellious and proud side.

Crazy Socks Show Our Uniqueness and Confidence

Dr. Adam Galinsky, a social psychologist from the Northwestern University, conducted a study that showed what we wear affects the way we think, feel and act.

When we put on our silly and crazy socks, we are partly showing off our uniqueness and our confidence. This then helps us get into the mindset of feeling good about ourselves. We are demonstrating to ourselves that we have the confidence to wear what we want and that we can embrace it.

This perception of ourselves helps us to develop a mentality of being successful.

Plain grey socks allow us to hide into the background of social norms whereas a nice pair of colored socks gives us the impression of giving two fingers up to the conforming attitudes of people around us.

If you’re a lover of fun and outlandish socks then go out in the world and embrace them.

You’ll end up giving off the perception of being a rebellious and creative spirit, and you’ll start to live up to that impression by cultivating a mindset of success.

"This Is What Happens When You Treat Mental Illness As Though It Were Physical Illness

Did you know that mental illness affects one in four people today? Despite this terrifying reality, it seems that people take physical diseases much more seriously than mental illnesses.

The reason for this is that we can actually see the wounds or symptoms of physical diseases, while for mental illness the symptoms are elusive at the best of times.

But just because things look fine on the surface doesn’t mean that sufferers of mental illness aren’t going through a significant amount of pain. Keep in mind that mental illness can happen to anyone, no matter how joyful or optimistic they may appear.

One of the most common misconceptions about mental illness is that people who have it lack the willpower to overcome their problems. This is incredibly inconsiderate and counterproductive to the person who is suffering from mental illness.

This misconception is brilliantly shown in this comic below by Robot Hugs.

When you give advice to someone suffering from mental illness based on wrong assumptions, you end up doing more harm than good. Those suffering from mental illness often feel misunderstood, which results in them withdrawing even more and suffering in silence.

Another common misconception about mental illness is that the illness manifests in the same ways for different people. The assumption is that a label makes diagnosis easy and coming up with a solution just a logical process to figure out. Yet very often people with mental illness are high functioning individuals and the condition they’re suffering is incredibly unique. This makes it even more difficult to figure out what is going on.

How you can help

The best way you can help anyone going through mental illness is to take the time to truly understand a person’s challenges without any assumptions or judgments. Make your loved ones feel loved and supported in a compassionate manner.

Professional help is required in many cases, yet the support offered by a family and closed friends is invaluable to the process of recovery even when therapy is involved.

If you or someone you know is experiencing mental illness, we recommend consulting a professional. You can also consider some online resources which we recommend for working on your own personal growth:

"Indian Buddhist Master Explains How to Conquer Negative Thinking in 5 Simple Steps

I think we can all agree that it’s easy to fall prey to negative thinking. As much as we try to follow the advice of staying positive, those negative and worrying thoughts creep in and take hold of our mindset.

There’s a lot of advice about how to combat negative thinking, but I find the most powerful to be the wisdom offered by the Indian Buddhist Master Paramahansa Yogananda.

We distilled his wisdom in 5 easy steps. The wisdom is powerful because it encourages you to face your inner demons rather than run away from them.

It gets better:

By following this advice, you’ll be taking responsibility for your own happiness. Who doesnt want that?

Step 1: Face up to your attachments and release them

“Attachments keep you ever fearful. The more a person’s body-consciousness expands – to include such things as a sense of possessions, a concern for one’s reputation, a sense of personal power or importance – the greater the likelihood of feeling fear. Fearlessness, on the other hand, comes from releasing those attachments: the desire for personal importance; the desire for power or control over anything or anyone; the desire to be well thought of and respected; attachment to possessions; attachment to bodily health and well-being; and, finally, identification of one’s self with the body. Fearlessness comes with perfect non-attachment. It is a natural attitude for those who feel they have nothing to protect.”

Step 2: Break the insidious hold of worrying thoughts

“Shake off your worries by going on ‘worry fasts.’ Go on short worry fasts three times a day to begin with. Take an hour in the morning, an hour at noon, and three hours in the evening. Absolutely refuse to allow a single worry thought to enter your mind during these periods. Then extend the period to a whole day; a week, and then a month. Soon you will have broken the insidious hold of worry thoughts.”

Step 3: Surround yourself with joyful people who laugh a lot

“Associate with joyous persons, for joy and laughter are contagious. There are some people the joy of whose laughter nothing can still. Seek them out, and feast with them on this most vitalizing food of joy. Steadfastly continue your laughter diet, and at the end of a month or two you will see a change – your mind will be filled with sunshine.”

Step 4: Act from the heart

“Fear comes from the heart. If ever you feel overcome by dread of some illness or accident, you should inhale and exhale deeply, slowly, and rhythmically several times, relaxing with each exhalation. This helps the circulation to become normal. If your heart is truly quiet you cannot feel fear at all.”

Step 5: Take control of your own mind

“God has given us one tremendous instrument of protection — more powerful than machine guns, electricity, poison gas, or any medic — the mind. It is the mind that must be strengthened… An important part of the adventure of life is to get hold of the mind, and to keep that controlled mind constantly attuned… This is the secret of a happy, successful existence… It comes by exercising mind power and by attuning the mind to God through meditation.”

"On this day 4 years ago something very significant happened in my life. I managed to turn one of the worst possible experiences of my life that sent me into depression for years into a positive. On this day 4 years ago I felt inspired by how I managed to turn my life around and I felt compelled to ask myself these questions, '' What will my legacy be and how will my children remember me? '' So I came home, opened my laptop and created a page called Educate Inspire Change and ...this is the status I wrote on my personal page immediately after.

''If you feel strongly about something then do something about it. For too long i have been keeping my thoughts to myself and letting them serve no purpose. I no longer want to be someone who just observes , there are too many people in the world who just sit on the sidelines. I don't want to be on the sidelines anymore, so I am trying to do what I can to make a difference. Even if i am unsuccessful...

I will know that i have at least tried and even if my efforts inspire just one other person to try and make a difference then my efforts will not have been in vain. I think it was Bob Marley who said ,""The people who are trying to make this world worse aren't taking the day off. Why should I?""

All around us there is injustice and inequality. If people like me and you just observe this and think that we cant do anything then that's exactly what will happen - nothing. I cant let it be on my conscience anymore, even if all you can do is educate yourself better on these matters then that is a step in the right direction.

I want to create a forum for people where i can raise awareness of issues that are important to people and give people a voice that can actually be heard. Its important to educate people on the truth, we need to let people know what is actually happening around the world.

I will look to highlight issues which expose inequalities and injustices around the globe and look to gather a large group of people who can contribute to helping inform and educate others on these issues. Imagine the possibilities if we can get enough people who are well informed and passionate about making the world we live in a better place all striving for the same goal.

Education is the most important tool that people can use to change the world, and sadly the world is full of misguided and uneducated people. We need to change this. Remember it only takes the smallest of sparks to light the biggest fire. Start somewhere, lets make a difference.'' - Kasim Khan"

One of the most common misconceptions about mental illness is that people who have it lack the willpower to overcome their problems. This is incredibly inconsiderate and counterproductive to the person who is suffering from mental illness.

This misconception is brilliantly shown in this comic below by Robot Hugs.

When you give advice to someone suffering from mental illness based on wrong assumptions, you end up doing more harm than good. Those suffering from mental illness often feel misunderstood, which results in them withdrawing even more and suffering in silence.

Another common misconception about mental illness is that the illness manifests in the same ways for different people. The assumption is that a label makes diagnosis easy and coming up with a solution just a logical process to figure out. Yet very often people with mental illness are high functioning individuals and the condition they’re suffering is incredibly unique. This makes it even more difficult to figure out what is going on.

How you can help

The best way you can help anyone going through mental illness is to take the time to truly understand a person’s challenges without any assumptions or judgments. Make your loved ones feel loved and supported in a compassionate manner.

Professional help is required in many cases, yet the support offered by a family and closed friends is invaluable to the process of recovery even when therapy is involved.

If you or someone you know is experiencing mental illness, we recommend consulting a professional. You can also consider some online resources which we recommend for working on your own personal growth:

"This Is What Happens When You Treat Mental Illness As Though It Were Physical Illness

Did you know that mental illness affects one in four people today? Despite this terrifying reality, it seems that people take physical diseases much more seriously than mental illnesses.

The reason for this is that we can actually see the wounds or symptoms of physical diseases, while for mental illness the symptoms are elusive at the best of times.

"Indian Buddhist Master Explains How to Conquer Negative Thinking in 5 Simple Steps

I think we can all agree that it’s easy to fall prey to negative thinking. As much as we try to follow the advice of staying positive, those negative and worrying thoughts creep in and take hold of our mindset.

There’s a lot of advice about how to combat negative thinking, but I find the most powerful to be the wisdom offered by the Indian Buddhist Master Paramahansa Yogananda.

We distilled his wisdom in 5 easy steps. The wisdom is powerful because it encourages you to face your inner demons rather than run away from them.

It gets better:

By following this advice, you’ll be taking responsibility for your own happiness. Who doesnt want that?

Step 1: Face up to your attachments and release them

“Attachments keep you ever fearful. The more a person’s body-consciousness expands – to include such things as a sense of possessions, a concern for one’s reputation, a sense of personal power or importance – the greater the likelihood of feeling fear. Fearlessness, on the other hand, comes from releasing those attachments: the desire for personal importance; the desire for power or control over anything or anyone; the desire to be well thought of and respected; attachment to possessions; attachment to bodily health and well-being; and, finally, identification of one’s self with the body. Fearlessness comes with perfect non-attachment. It is a natural attitude for those who feel they have nothing to protect.”

Step 2: Break the insidious hold of worrying thoughts

“Shake off your worries by going on ‘worry fasts.’ Go on short worry fasts three times a day to begin with. Take an hour in the morning, an hour at noon, and three hours in the evening. Absolutely refuse to allow a single worry thought to enter your mind during these periods. Then extend the period to a whole day; a week, and then a month. Soon you will have broken the insidious hold of worry thoughts.”

Step 3: Surround yourself with joyful people who laugh a lot

“Associate with joyous persons, for joy and laughter are contagious. There are some people the joy of whose laughter nothing can still. Seek them out, and feast with them on this most vitalizing food of joy. Steadfastly continue your laughter diet, and at the end of a month or two you will see a change – your mind will be filled with sunshine.”

Step 4: Act from the heart

“Fear comes from the heart. If ever you feel overcome by dread of some illness or accident, you should inhale and exhale deeply, slowly, and rhythmically several times, relaxing with each exhalation. This helps the circulation to become normal. If your heart is truly quiet you cannot feel fear at all.”

Step 5: Take control of your own mind

“God has given us one tremendous instrument of protection — more powerful than machine guns, electricity, poison gas, or any medic — the mind. It is the mind that must be strengthened… An important part of the adventure of life is to get hold of the mind, and to keep that controlled mind constantly attuned… This is the secret of a happy, successful existence… It comes by exercising mind power and by attuning the mind to God through meditation.”

"Show Yourself Compassion: 4 Mindful Ways to Stop Negative Self-Talk

We’ve all been confronted by that nagging voice in our heads that makes us feel about two inches tall.

“How could you do something so stupid?”

“You’re never going to be good enough.”

These thoughts can race around in your mind, increasing stress and anxiety in all areas of your life. Luckily, you have the power to put a stop to the vicious cycle of negative self-talk! By showing yourself compassion and releasing your self-judgement, you can silence that nagging voice and build up your self confidence.

These simple strategies will start you on the path to a more positive pattern of self-talk:

1) Become Aware of your Negative Thoughts

Acknowledging negative self-talk removes the power that it has over you. When you find yourself caught up in a web of self-depreciation, consciously stop and examine each thought as it comes through. When you slow down and identify the thought pattern going through your mind, you acknowledge the feeling behind it and can then move forward with releasing it.

2) Swap Negative Self-Talk with Affirmative Statements

“Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.”

This famous quote from Martin Luther King, Jr. forms the foundation for eliminating the pattern of negative self-talk from your life.

Negative thoughts are often part of a vicious cycle in which one thought spawns into another, dragging you down physically and emotionally. By inserting a positive, affirmative statement into your thought pattern you can stop this cycle in its tracks. Make a list of positive statements or affirmations that you can use when your inner critic comes out to play.

3) Understand the Power of your Thoughts

Albert Einstein once said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and expecting different results. The same is true in your thought patterns. When we regularly get drawn into the cycle of negative self-talk, we create a reality based upon those thoughts. By recognizing the triggers to your negative thoughts and consciously replacing them with positive self-talk based on possibilities, you can change the perspective of your entire reality.

4) Release your Negative Thoughts

Often the negative thought patterns we create in our minds feed off each other to make a problem seem much bigger than it is in reality. Release these thoughts by visualizing them in physical form.

An excellent way to do this is by writing a letter to yourself. When you feel caught up in negative emotion, writing it out on paper releases it from the confines of your mind and takes away the power those thoughts have over you. When you are finished with the letter, either burn it or put it away into a “worry box”. Physically releasing thoughts that no longer serve you is a powerful tool to shift the cycle of negative thinking.

There will always be times when our thoughts get stuck in a pattern of negative thinking. Be gentle with yourself, and let go of guilt and self-judgement.

By replacing negative thoughts with positive affirmations and releasing thought patterns that no longer serve you, you will discover that you do have the power within you to rise above the trap of negative self-talk.

"If You’re Intelligent You Should Spend More Time Alone, According to Research

We’ve heard so many times that being surrounded by people boosts one’s happiness.

Our happiest moments are with people we love and trust. It makes sense that there’s a strong correlation between happiness and companionship.

However, recent studies show that this fact may not be true for all. In fact, there’s actually only a single study that suggests that these correlations are true.

It could be that we’re happier around less people, and intelligent people need to spend more time alone.

The Savannah Theory of Happiness

Researchers from Singapore Management University and London School of Economics have completed a thorough investigation on what they call the “savannah theory” of happiness. This theory, which relates back to our ancestors’ time and way of living in savannah, looks into the psychological needs of a person.

The study looked for correlations between rural and urban areas and the population’s life satisfaction. The findings suggested that people living in dense populations reflecting bigger cities and fast-paced environments felt less happy than their counterparts in less dense populations.

This connects back to the savannah theory that humans naturally feel uneasy when in larger packs, with the brain only allowing us to be comfortable with up to 150 people at one time around us. After exceeding 200 people, it’s more reasonable to break the group into two for efficient functionality and cooperation.



It’s not to say that we are scientifically happier alone, as evolution has allowed our smarter ancestors to strategically adapt to larger groups on the savannah due to flexibility and innate ingenuity. This adaption lead our descendants to be able to encounter and adapt efficiently to stress when in dense populous environments.

Intelligent People Are Happier Alone

On another point, the researchers have found by looking at groups of highly intelligent people, that socializing with friends too much seems to give them less life satisfaction – they feel happier when spending time alone. Possibly due to social interactions distracting them from their goal-oriented life.

It’s hard to say what’s true or not, as we all have different needs and opinions on what makes us happy. There are lot of contradicting theories on the study of happiness, and there really isn’t a rule for it.

"Is Male Circumcision A Violation Of Human Rights?

By Collective Evolution

While flipping through the WestJet TV lineup on a recent cross-country flight, I reluctantly settled for a popular daytime talk-show (my other options included Days of Our Lives and re-runs of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo), which saw a panel of 4 diversely opinionated women duking it out to see who could make their co-host seem like the bigger idiot. Sigh.

Interestingly, however, the subject they were debating that day happened to be male circumcision, a surprising topic for daytime TV.

Two of the female hosts in particular were taking the stage with polarizing views on the matter. One host saw the medical procedure as a hygienic practice that lowered the risk of disease while the other saw it as an archaic and highly irrelevant surgery.

In the end, the audience was left undecided. I, however, was left with an ignited curiosity about a medical procedure that I had never really taken time to question.

I was impressed by the research the anti-circumcision host had prepared for her debate, and it got me thinking intently about the ethics behind the globally rooted practice.

How Did Circumcision Come To Be Globally Recognized?

While the true origins of circumcision are largely obscured, the procedure undoubtedly has ancient roots, as documented in findings from several ethnic groups, including ancient Egypt, Greece, and Sub-equatorial Africa.

It has been proposed that the procedure began for a number of reasons, including serving as a rite of passage marking a boy’s entrance into adulthood or as a form of sympathetic magic to ensure virility or fertility. It could also have been started as a means of reducing sexual pleasure, marking those of higher social status, aiding hygiene where regular bathing was impractical, or even humiliating enemies and slaves by symbolic castration.

By the 1890s, it became a popular technique to prevent, or cure, masturbatory insanity.

Sadly, female circumcision is still practiced in certain areas of the world today, although efforts are being made to put a stop to it.

Clitoridectomies (removal of the clitoris) were also performed for the same reason, and were widely practiced in the US until 1925. This of course was until someone recognized the absurdity of such an invasive and irrelevant medical procedure.

Yet even still, male circumcision continued onwards unto further generations of men.

Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that globally one-third of males aged 15 years and over are circumcised, with almost 70% of those being Muslims.

To Cut Or Not To Cut

Surprisingly, even though circumcision is still performed by most surgeons today, many leading medical institutions show no favour towards the procedure.

Take the New England Journal of Medicine, for example:

“Failure to provide adequate control of pain amounts to substandard and unethical medical practice.“

The American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement on circumcision:

“Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.“ (AAP 1999)

The British Medical Association:

“[P]arental preference alone is not sufficient justification for performing a surgical procedure on a child.” (BMA 2006)

Even the Canadian Paediatric Society has reservations about circumcision:

“Circumcision of newborns should not be routinely performed.“ (CPS 1996)

Perhaps the reason most medical institutions show no favor towards circumcision has something to do with one of medicine’s first code of ethics, “First, do no harm.”

Removing a normal, healthy body part and causing unnecessary pain is in fact doing harm.

Pardon my rudeness, but the common rebuttal that states “the pain only lasts for a minute” is both incorrect and inhumane.

We know that a baby has nerve endings in their genitals at birth, therefore surgically cutting a newborn’s penis undoubtedly causes extreme pain for the baby. Even if it were only for a ‘minute’ (which it’s not), such an argument also implies it is okay to inflict unnecessary pain on an infant, even if only temporarily.

Furthermore, circumcision without anesthesia is inconsistent with ethical guidelines that prohibit performing surgical procedures on live beings without anesthesia.

Money, Autonomy, and Misguided Parental Decisions

In her article, “Circumcision Ethics and Economics,” author Darcia Narvaez states that her anti-circumcision stance comes down to money, autonomy, and parental intentions.

For one, Narvaez explains how much money we actually waste on the procedure.

Medicaid spends $198 million each year on routine infant circumcision in the 33 states that still pay for it, a procedure its own guidelines consider to be medically unnecessary. Private insurance programs are reimbursing an additional $677 million, raising prices for us all (Craig 2006.) In addition to the cost of circumcision itself, correcting its complications are said to double the cost, bringing the total bill to $1.75 billion each year. Is this what we should be spending money on during a recession and at a time when healthcare costs are skyrocketing?

Complications indeed, not to mention the average 117 neonatal circumcision-related deaths (9.01/100,000) which occur annually in the United States.

Secondly, Narvaez points out that everyone has a right to bodily autonomy and self-determination, and that the only person qualified to make the medical decision is “the owner of the penis, as he is the one going to have to live with the results, not his parents.”

Another valid point brought up by Narvaez comes down to the fact that parents’ “aesthetic preferences are not valid reasons for circumcision.”

While all of her points speak truth in some regard, there are arguments for circumcision that should also be looked at.

Risk of Disease?

The most common arguments for circumcision comes down to hygiene and risk of disease. Increased risk of spreading and contracting HPV, cervical cancer, and HIV are the big ones most commonly mentioned.

However, when one actually takes the time to look at the studies which suggest this correlation, it’s extremely easy to see how weak that correlation is (fortunately).

A 2002 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine studied men in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, and found that circumcision was correlated with a decreased risk of penile HPV infection (this correlation is corroborated by a 2009 study in African men), but that there was not a significant correlation between circumcision and incidence of cervical cancer.

Does circumcision truly reduce the chances of contracting or spreading HPV and HIV? Is there enough correlation to draw conclusions?

When they restricted their dataset to women with only one sexual partner, there was an increased risk of cervical cancer in women whose partners were uncircumcised only if their partner was already considered at high risk for contracting HPV (as determined by age at first intercourse, number of sexual partners, and sex with prostitutes). So, in men who already engage in risky sexual behavior, circumcision does offer an advantage for protecting their partners from cervical cancer.

Yes, circumcision reduces the mucosal surface area, thereby potentially minimizing the interface for abrasion and transmission of viruses, but again, this is a weak reason for surgical intervention.

Women also have many crevices and folds in their genitals, yet we don’t automatically assume to surgically remove their labia for hygienic purposes.

It’s called showering.

Facing Reality

Routine infant circumcision is a 90-year aberration among hundreds of thousands of years of our time here as homo-sapiens.

Furthermore, manmade traditions have never been the basis for scientific principles, so why have we chosen to hold on to such an archaic way of thinking with regards to circumcision?

Thankfully, these traditions are on their way out soon, with only 30% of American boys circumcised in 2009. It seems that more and more parents are seeing through the silly traditions of our past while looking to create a more reasonable future for us all.

Perhaps one day we will look back at a list of all the strange things we once accepted as normal and laugh, with circumcision topping the list of these absurdities.

A 2002 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine studied men in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, and found that circumcision was correlated with a decreased risk of penile HPV infection (this correlation is corroborated by a 2009 study in African men), but that there was not a significant correlation between circumcision and incidence of cervical cancer.

Does circumcision truly reduce the chances of contracting or spreading HPV and HIV? Is there enough correlation to draw conclusions?

When they restricted their dataset to women with only one sexual partner, there was an increased risk of cervical cancer in women whose partners were uncircumcised only if their partner was already considered at high risk for contracting HPV (as determined by age at first intercourse, number of sexual partners, and sex with prostitutes). So, in men who already engage in risky sexual behavior, circumcision does offer an advantage for protecting their partners from cervical cancer.

Yes, circumcision reduces the mucosal surface area, thereby potentially minimizing the interface for abrasion and transmission of viruses, but again, this is a weak reason for surgical intervention.

Women also have many crevices and folds in their genitals, yet we don’t automatically assume to surgically remove their labia for hygienic purposes.

It’s called showering.

Facing Reality

Routine infant circumcision is a 90-year aberration among hundreds of thousands of years of our time here as homo-sapiens.

Furthermore, manmade traditions have never been the basis for scientific principles, so why have we chosen to hold on to such an archaic way of thinking with regards to circumcision?

Thankfully, these traditions are on their way out soon, with only 30% of American boys circumcised in 2009. It seems that more and more parents are seeing through the silly traditions of our past while looking to create a more reasonable future for us all.

Perhaps one day we will look back at a list of all the strange things we once accepted as normal and laugh, with circumcision topping the list of these absurdities.

"It Was Only a Matter of Time: Scientists Found a Way to Reverse Signs of Aging

Aging is a crucial part of life. We all have to undergo this phase and we all know the signs such as wrinkles, graying of hair, getting diagnosed with diseases related to aging, etc.

Scientists have been researching and studying the process of aging for years. The process takes place at the cellular level – which the scientists have discovered – can be either reversed or stopped altogether. And the scientists from Salk Institute have found a way to reverse aging.

REVERSAL OF THE AGING PROCESS

The research dwells into the possible ways of stem cell-like conditions and their replication via gene intermittent expressions. It is in the association with an embryonic state. Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte – the senior author and professor of Salk Gene Expression Laboratory – says the aging process does not have to move in one direction. It consists of plasticity. With cautious modulation, the aging process can be reversed.

The cellular rejuvenation was prompted by the researchers via the cell reprogramming – which causes expression activation of four genes – also called the Yamanaka factors.

The cell conversion process is induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs, and it enables them to replicate stem cell behavior – which allows them to become different cells and gain the capability of a division. The approach produced some amazing results – where the skin cells when placed in a dish, start to behaving like the young cells.

LABORATORY EXPERIMENT BROUGHT FORTH

Alejandro Ocampo – co-author of the paper and a research associate at the Salk Gene Expression Laboratory – says that the induction of cellular reprogramming makes the cells appear young. But the real deal is to induce the process of rejuvenation in live animals.

iPSCs don’t always prove to be a good thing because non-stop cellular division can cause cancer-oriented behavior and lead to organ failure. The team tested the technique but on a genetic disease (rare) – progeria.

"15 Enlightening Quotes From a Japanese Zen Master That Will Liberate Your Thinking

Soyen Shaku is noted as one of the first Master Zen Buddhists to have traveled to the United States to teach the way of the Zen.

At the time, most of Shaku’s followers believed it was beneath a Zen master to go to a country such as the US, which Japan saw at the time as barbaric.

Despite this opposition, Shaku would eventually become the most significant figure in bringing Zen to the West. Below are a list of quotes that offer a much needed and unique perspective for all of us.

On receiving guests

“Receive a guest with the same attitude you have when alone. When alone, maintain the same attitude you have in receiving guests.”

On attitude

“Have the fearless attitude of a hero and the loving heart of a child.”

“Watch what you say, and whatever you say, practice it.”

“When an opportunity comes do not let it pass by, yet always think twice before acting.”

On sleep

“Upon retiring, sleep as if you had entered your last sleep. Upon awakening, leave your bed behind you instantly as if you had cast away a pair of old shoes.”

No regrets

“Do not regret the past. Look to the future.”

Perfect morning routine

“In the morning before dressing, light incense and meditate.”

On becoming Buddha

“Zen is the way of complete self-realization; a living human being who follows the way of Zen can attain satori and then live a new life as a Buddha”

“All beings by nature are Buddhas, as ice by nature is water. Apart from water there is no ice; apart from beings, no Buddhas.”

On the real you

“Live the Self that fills the whole Universe.”

“We live in group stupidity and confuse this insanity with true experience. It is essential that you become transparent to yourself and wake up from this madness. Zazen means taking leave of the group and walking on your own two feet.”

“Man makes a clever face and talks about being lord on Earth. And at the same time he doesn’t even know where to begin with his own body: he watches sports on television and defends himself saying that everyone else does it too.”

On happiness

“Human happiness and unhappiness doesn’t only depend on money. If the balance in your savings account were a measure of your happiness, it would be a simple matter. Yet it really isn’t so.”

Aren’t we all the same?

“We often wonder who here is really better? But aren’t we all made out of the same lump of clay?”

On peace

“You cry out, “Peace, peace!” , but if you would only be quiet, it would be so much more peaceful. You say, “In my opinion…”, but it’s precisely when opinions and theories come into the picture that the bickering starts.”

"New Research: Semen May Actually Cure Depression In Women

Researchers at the University of Albany may have a new anti-depression strategy: Sexual intimacy.

A study led by University of Albany Pyschology Professor Gordon Gallup found that among females having sex, those women who did not use condoms showed fewer signs of depression, leading to speculation that when semen is absorbed through the vagina, it may have an effect on women’s moods.

The study in particular relied on what is known as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a survey which is widely used to measure individual differences in symptoms of depression.

As part of the study, around 300 different women filled out anonymous questionnaires that addressed various aspects of their sexual behavior, including how often they had sexual intercourse, when they last had sex, and whether or not they used condoms.

As Gallup noted, the results showed that “females who engaged in sexual intercourse but never used condoms exhibited significantly lower scores on the BDI than those who usually or always used condoms.”

While 300 women is still a relatively small sample size, the researchers tried to control for other variables, including the frequency of sexual intercourse, the use of other types of contraceptives (such as birth control pills), and whether or not the female was in a relationship, but found that condom use accounted for more of a swing in the likelihood of depressive symptoms than any of the other variables.

Of course, there are other questions that remain to be answered, it may point to a link between condom usage and the high frequency of depressive symptoms in sexually active female college students.

Gallup noted, however, that these findings are not an excuse for irresponsible behavior.

“Regardless of the findings, this study does not advocate that people abstain from using condoms,” said Professor Gallup. “Protecting oneself from an unwanted pregnancy or a sexually transmitted disease is far more important.”

"The One Surprisingly Simple Rule That Will Bring More Joy Into Your Life

Do you ever feel like you’re drowning in work? Getting deeper and deeper under the pile of actions you need to tick off so that you can be satisfied with your work week?

It happens to a lot of us, especially us millennials who feel the struggling need to climb that corporate ladder.

The pressure to succeed is all around. The luxury life, those perfect instagram shots portraying the ‘good life’, the movies that tell us that having a surplus of cash brings the best joy.

We have been sucked in. We have been sucked into a reality that isn’t real, and we are starting to move further away to what the simple joys in life are.

As a twenty-six year old, I guess you could say it’s the prime age to really have life under control. Six months ago, my calendar was full of meetings, and only work related meetings, my days of looking at the computer screen were continuously getting longer and time spent at home were getting shorter.

To put it simply, my life revolved around this job. I used to cancel gym classes and plans to learn recipes to cook dinner because they weren’t high priority compared to the job I have.

The One Simple Rule You Should Try

But it wasn’t until one day, all of sudden I had a meltdown. It occurred to me that I was not working to live, but I was living to work. It was scary to step back and view my typical week, there was minimal time for me to do things that made me laugh and happy.

It really gave me a wake up call, a bit of a quarter life crisis. I needed to change and start focusing on the happy things in life, especially at this sweet age of twenty-six.

I knew I was great at getting things done at work, but not for my leisure. I started understanding what it was and changed some of my habits in order to accommodate my personal life.

The one rule of thumb for me now is to schedule one exciting thing for me a week – something that is purely for enjoyment.

I make sure it is in my calendar, because if I can commit to work related items in my calendar, I can commit to personal related items too.

After six months, I can confidently say that my work life balance has tremendously improved. I’m happier, I look forward to the weeks and I now am collecting meaningful experiences that I used to be so bad at keeping. It’s so simple, and everyone has the capability to make it happen.

1. Quinoa

Quinoa is a great source of fiber and protein; it also has the benefit of being gluten-free. Quinoa is one of the best superfoods to eat because it also contains great levels of nutrients such as manganese, magnesium, phosphorous, iron, zinc, copper and potassium.

2. Spinach

We’ve all seen Popeye. We have all seen Popeye, right?

Spinach is highly nutrient-dense; containing high levels of vitamin K, vitamin A, manganese, folate, magnesium, iron, copper, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, vitamin E, calcium, potassium, and vitamin C. And those are just the ones we could be bothered to list!

3. Lentils

Lentils should be a staple for all diets; particularly vegans and vegetarians. They’re a great source of plant-protein; and have been proven to improve the health of your heart, digestion, your energy levels, and lower your cholesterol.

4. Kale

Kale is what spinach used to be! Kale contains a lot of the same properties as spinach, including vitamin K, vitamin C, vitamin A, manganese, and copper; a very good source of vitamin B6, fiber, calcium, potassium, vitamin E, and vitamin B2; and a good source of iron, magnesium vitamin B1, omega-3 fats, phosphorus, protein, folate, and vitamin B3.

5. Green Tea

If you’re not making green tea a part of your diet, you’re missing out. It still contains a small amount of caffeine, and a ton of anti-oxidant properties. Green tea is great for your skin, your dental health, your heart, and your blood pressure.

6. Blueberries

Blueberries contain a great number of anti-oxidants, and they’re also a good source of Vitamin K, Vitamin C and Manganese. Plus, it’s incredibly easy for you to eat a handful of them at any given time of the day. So why not go out and buy some?

10. Chia Seeds

Chia seeds are very high in omega-3 fatty acids. They also contain a great deal of fiber, magnesium, manganese and calcium, making them an incredibly nutrient denser superfood.

11. Strawberries

As far as fruits go, strawberries are among the healthiest. They’re packed with anti-oxidants, and studies have proven that they help to lower blood pressure and improve the overall health of your heart. Strawberries are definitely worthy of being on the top 20 superfoods list.

12. Oatmeal

Oatmeal might seem fairly basic to most. However since it’s a whole grain, eating oatmeal can help you lose weight, lower your cholesterol, and reduce the risk of various diseases, including type 2 diabetes.

13. Leaks

There are a wide range of benefits associated with leaks, most importantly the reduced risk of certain cancers. They also help fight infections, improve your digestion, strengthen your bones and protect your heart.

14. Ginger

Ginger is a crucial ingredient in meals throughout the Asian culture. Ginger has been linked to improving muscle recovery time, treating nausea and other illnesses, and lowering blood sugar levels.

15. Spirulina

Spirulina is more popular among the vegan community, and it’s not exactly the tastiest of foods. However, spirulina is the most protein dense food on the planet! That’s right, you heard me. 100g of the stuff contains 65g of protein!

16. Wheatgrass

Wheatgrass is normally sold in powder format, virtually the same as with spirulina. You can add 5g of it to your juice, shakes or water. Wheatgrass is a wonderfully nutrient-dense food, and a great source of fiber. The taste is terrible, but it only takes a few seconds to get this in your diet every day.

17. Beets

Beets are a brilliant source of folate and of manganese, potassium and copper. They’re also a good source of dietary fiber, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin C, iron and vitamin B6.

18. Beans

Beans come in all different varieties; however they’re all pretty damn good for you. Beans in general contain high quantities of essential vitamins, and are a great source of protein. Check out pinto beans, kidney beans, and garbanzo beans.

19. Cranberries

Cranberries don’t buck the trend of berries in general. They’re also full of antioxidants, anti-inflammatory properties, and anti-cancer health benefits. Plus, they are a very good source of vitamin C, dietary fiber, and manganese, as well as a good source of vitamin E, vitamin K, copper and pantothenic acid.

20. Avocados

Last on this list of the top 20 superfoods to eat for great health; is avocados.

Avocados are interesting because there’s no real taste or texture to them. It’s like putting a snowflake on your tongue… one that doesn’t melt. They contain a substantial amount of healthy monounsaturated fatty acids, are a nutrient-dense food and contain nearly 20 vitamins and minerals.

Summary

The great thing about superfoods is that you don’t need to eat much of them to acquire all your RDA for every nutrient the body requires. They’re very powerful foods, and anyone who takes advantage of more than one is going to be on their way to great health.

This is just a list of 20 of our favorite superfoods, but there are plenty more to watch out for and give a try!

Which is your favorite superfood?

"A bachelor or bachelorette party is supposed to be a proper send-off for the groom and the bride. Most people celebrate it by having wild and fun nights with their friends as it is considered the last day of freedom for a bride and a groom. One woman, though, took it too far with her bachelorette party that she ended up losing her groom-to-be.

A man who’s supposed to get married to the love of his life had to cancel the big day after seeing a video of his wife-to-be screwing another man. Reportedly, the video was hacked and got sent to the groom. In the video, the woman can be seen surrounded by her friends cheering for her as she gets banged hard by a stripper at her bachelorette party.

A certain Carmelo Delva posted the said video on Facebook, which then went viral, garnering 17 thousand shares online in just a short period of time. Carmelo stated in his post that the husband immediately called off the wedding after he saw his soon-to-be-wife having a great time with the stripper. It even gets lewder toward the end of the video as the guy finishes off.

This is reminiscent of a story of one bride who got pregnant with a dwarf stripper, when she had unprotected sex with him during her bachelorette party. When she gave birth and found that her child had dwarfism, she was left with no choice but to confess to her husband about the sexual encounter.

Now, there’s that question on whether or not you’d do the same thing as the groom did in the story if it happened to you. Would you call off the celebration like the groom did or would you forgive your woman, sweep it under the rug and let it go, convincing yourself that it was just a one-time wild act? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.

"Kidneys play an important role in keeping your body healthy. These internal organs act pretty much like filters, eradicating your bodily toxins and getting rid of excess water. It is, therefore, crucial that you take good care of your kidneys as they also take good care of you.

Well to begin with, there are some bad habits you should stop doing or you might end up damaging your kidneys badly.

Read on and learn:

1. Not drinking enough water.

First and foremost, inadequate water consumption can lead to kidney risks. As mentioned above, kidneys work like filters in the sense that they drain wastes from our systems. So if you’re not drinking enough amounts of water, the renal blood flow decreases and that could lead to accumulation of bodily toxins.

2. Delaying bathroom time.

To keep your kidneys healthy, you gotta go when you gotta go. Keeping your bladder full isn’t exactly a good idea – even if you are extremely busy. Do not delay going to the bathroom or you might experience complications later on.



3. Excessive intake of sodium.

Are you a big fan of salty foods? Well you might want to cut on that since excessive sodium intake can lead to health problems as well. Besides, kidneys really find it difficult to excrete sodium.

4. Too much coffee and caffeinated drinks.

While it is okay to drink coffee occasionally, being addicted to it – and other caffeinated drinks, such as soda – can totally harm your kidneys because these beverages elevate the blood pressure."
"In all the 195 countries of the world which ones do you think have the best-looking women? I’m sure that the answers to this question will differ greatly as everyone has their own idea of what an attractive lady should look like, but data has been gathered, and conclusions have been made.

There are certainly some countries in the world that appear to be more filled with stunning females than others.

#15. Philippines

The dark-haired beauties of the Philippines are second in the world for the most placements in top beauty pageants, and are girls who are not only pretty, but sweet-natured too."
"If you have ever seen the work of James Fridman, you’d be fully aware by now that asking for free Photoshop help over the internet isn’t exactly the wisest of ideas. This photo editor trolls people who make free requests and churns out insanely hilarious results.

Well apparently, Fridman’s kind has multiplied on the web as several Korean guys are following his footsteps. One Facebook page called We Do Phosop (yes, you read it right – that’s not a typo) offers free Photoshop editing help for interested individuals. The catch, however, is that they’d either take your requests literally or just simply give them a funny spin.

"The Philippine government has long been plagued by terrorist groups operating in some locations in Mindanao, which is one of the country’s three main islands. Over the years, residents have gotten used to the periodic skirmishes between the military and terrorists who are known for their kidnapping schemes. Most of the time, foreigners are abducted and ransom is demanded. Some of these local terrorists have sought validation from the extremist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS, which is also known as Daesh or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or ISIL.

The name ISIS was once in the headlines. This time around, the expressions of support for the group seem to be the most intense in one area in Mindanao. Indeed, that area is now experiencing hostilities right smack in the middle of the city.

The Philippine military vs. a terrorist group.

Recently, violence broke out between government forces and members of a terrorist group in the city of Marawi in the province of Lanao del Sur in the Philippines. Lanao del Sur is part of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).

A soldier points at ISIS graffiti in Marawi City.

It all started when the combined government forces conducted a raid on a house where Isnilon Hapilon was staying. Hapilon is identified as the leader of the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf. Hapilon’s forces called the Maute Group to help them. The Maute Group is responsible for the bombing in Davao City — where President Rodrigo Duterte is from — last year.

The Maute Group obviously invested in ISIS-inspired paraphernalia.

Despite that, the Philippine government has issued announcements that these terrorists are simply members of the so-called Maute Group. The group is named after its founders, brothers Omar and Abdullah Maute. The authorities have emphasized that the Maute Group is not recognized by ISIS.



These were confiscated from the Maute Group.

Maute Group members have raised the ISIS flag in several locations in Marawi City. Evidently, they are seeking validation by doing acts of terror supposedly in behalf of ISIS.

Thus, members of the Maute Group ended up taking over some parts of Marawi City. They engaged in violent shootouts with government forces and burned down some establishments. They also took some hostages. This prompted the declaration of martial law all over Mindanao.

Soldiers spot more ISIS-inspired graffiti.

In line with this, the Daily Mail quoted military spokesman Brigadier-General Restituto Padilla who warned,

“We call on the remaining terrorists to surrender while there is an opportunity. For the terrorists, not surrendering will mean their sure death.”

Government troops go through Marawi City.

There are horrible stories about the ISIS-inspired group’s takeover of some parts of Marawi City. One of these stories is, indeed, very disturbing, as some of the fighters are said to be teenage boys.

It can't be denied that this is a war zone.

Apparently, these ISIS teen fighters play a sadistic game wherein they ask people to recite verses from the Koran. When these people can’t recite a verse, they are shot.

Who pays the price in a war zone? Answer: Civilians.

Moreover, with the outbreak of violence, around 50,000 residents of Marawi have fled the city.

ISIS fighters pose with ""captured vehicles.""

However, there are still around 2,000 trapped in some areas taken over by the Maute Group members. “More than 100 people have been confirmed killed in the conflict,” adds Gareth Davies for MailOnline.

A terrorist celebrates.

Meanwhile, the hostilities continue in Marawi City. In fact, government troops are said to be liberating Marawi City “from house to house.”"
"Many of us fear death while others seem to chase it consciously. Thrill-seekers and daredevils, with their thirst for risk and adventure, oftentimes put their lives in grave danger. Indeed, danger can induce euphoria for some.

One Lithuanian engineer named Julijonas Urbonas probably had this in mind when he designed the Euthanasia Coaster, a rollercoaster meant to literally kill its passengers. Now, the killer ride has not been made, and there are currently no plans of actually build it.

The Euthanasia Coaster was specifically designed to kill its passengers.

Urbonas designed the structure in 2010 as a Ph.D. candidate in design interactions at the Royal College of Art in London. He developed a fondness for amusement parks during the years he worked at one, and he saw the horror-movie scenario of dying in a rollercoaster as an alternative death ritual.

The ride was designed by Lithuanian engineer Julijonas Urbonas.

The giant big-dipper design of the ride is meant to take passengers through a series of extreme drops and loops, which would then create euphoria and then kill the passengers by depriving their brains of oxygen.

First, the riders would face a slow climb up to about 500 meters, during which they can think back on their life. Once at the top, there would be time for them to say a prayer or to bail. If they decide to proceed, they can press the ‘fall’ button, which will send them plummeting into a long and steep plunge followed by the series of 360-degree loops.

The steep and long fall, followed by a series of 360-degree loops, will kill the passengers.

The design would kill most passengers during the first loop. According to Urbonas, traveling at 100 meters per second, a person would experience a G-force-induced loss of consciousness due to lack of oxygen in the brain, which often causes euphoria. In case the first loop doesn’t kill the passengers, there are six more loops to supposedly finish the job.



“It would be a meaningful death: For the faller, it is a painless, whole-body engaging and ritualized death machine.”

Watch Urbonas talk about his Euthanasia Coaster design below.

Like on Facebook

When the design was first made public, many anti-euthanasia groups expressed outrage. However, Urbonas believes his design can pave the way to an alternative way of ending life. He was quoted as saying:

How about you? What do you think of this design concept?"
"Maute, a group of ISIS-inspired militants, has recently been causing chaos in the southern part of the Philippines, particularly in the city of Marawi. According to reports, they’ve terrorized and burned establishments, taken hostages, killed civilians, and even brandished a black ISIS flag in the area.

The military has since been going after them while rescuing residents and conducting airstrikes at the same time. Also, the entire island of Mindanao has been placed under Martial Law by President Rodrigo Duterte.

In the middle of all the clash, however, locals said that stray dogs have been feasting on corpses scattered in the streets of Marawi.

In an Inquirer article, 20-year-old Norhidaya Imam, a Marawi resident described:

“There were many dead civilians, and the dogs were eating them. I saw it myself. In our village alone there were many civilians hit by bombs fired by the military.”

Members of the Maute terror group placed an ISIS flag in a police car in front of a local hospital.

Imam is currently staying in an evacuation center located in the town of Balo-I, Lanao del Norte. She is with her husband Bokhary, 22, and their 1-year-old daughter. They left Marawi and weren’t able to bring any of their belongings.

Bokhary added:

“And we have no reason to go back because our house was destroyed by bombs.”

The airstrikes have resulted to unimaginable destruction to mosques, houses, and other establishments.

Government authorities have repeatedly received information about the need to retrieve bodies from several parts of the city.

Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has started that they are concerned about the civilians trapped in the area.

In an interview, ICRC deputy country head Martin Thalmann described that the Marawi situation is “very fluid” because of ongoing military operations. He also pointed out:

“The Geneva Convention is very concerned about civilians in such conflict situation … the fighting parties need to respect civilians and not to indiscriminately bombard their areas. “We ask both sides that they [be] careful, that they respect the life of civilians and give them, if possible, time to move out of the [danger] zones.”

The security crisis is so intense that declaring a ceasefire seems impossible at the moment.

"Dance is a remarkable art form. It can showcase creativity, express individuality, tell a story, and just move people. There are countless types of dance being practiced today ranging from traditional to modern. Different spots around the world have dances they are proud to perform, as these routines preserve and highlight their culture.

In Russia, there’s a folk dance that’s been mesmerizing all who get to see it. The music, the movements, and the mysterious technique used by the performers come together to create an unforgettable viewing experience. Even netizens who have only witnessed the dance through video recordings are freaking out – in a good way.

See the incredible Berezka Ensemble do their famous folk dance routine below.

Like on Facebook

The Berezka Ensemble is a Russian dance troupe that performs a one-of-a-kind folk dance. The Berezka dance originated in 1948 and has since been captivating audiences the world over.



The dancers use a technique called ‘sliding steps’ or ‘floating steps’ while performing the dance.

The dancers use a technique called ‘sliding steps’ or ‘floating steps’ because, as you can see in the video, the dancers appear to float and glide above the floor. It has been described as both mesmerizing and haunting.

The female dancers are reportedly made to vow secrecy about the exact technique they use for the dance. Some believe that the illusion of floating is created by tiny gliding steps along with the special skirts worn by the performers. The small careful movements, plus the slightly puffy skirt, mask the actual steps made by the dancers.

We certainly don’t mind the mystery behind this folk dance routine. In fact, the secrecy seems to add more character and wonder to the dance. Regardless of how they do it, we’re just glad we have such an art form to admire."
"Playing around with snakes isn’t something that most people would willingly do, especially when it involves venomous species. For YouTube presenter Nick Bishop, or “Nick the Wrangler,” searching for North America’s most dangerous venomous snake species, the Eastern diamondback rattlesnake, is a must so he can study it and probably have something to show to his audience.

While he was taking a break after a futile search, one just came up to him and even got close to him more than it should. The good thing is that the camera kept rolling to capture all of it.

YouTuber Nick the Wrangler was searching for rattlesnakes, when one decided to show up next to him.

Nick remained calm but the venomous viper decided to check him out a bit.

As Nick wrote in the video description:

“I heard a rustle in the brush next to me. I take a better look to see an Eastern diamondback rattlesnake crawling towards me, so I just sat there as still as possible.”

The rattlesnake even crawled up into his lap.

Nick thought that the snake would leave him alone, but instead, the viper stopped to check him out.

“I tried to get him to keep moving but he rushed up onto my lap. This was a very close call.”

One would not dare play around with a rattlesnake like that.

Although one would think Nick’s experience was terrifyingly crazy, the presenter was trying to make a point.

“This just proves that Rattlesnakes are not out to harm us. They only bite as a last resort. Their venom is for hunting, it is valuable to them and they only use it when needed.”

Check out the terrifying moment when Nick the Wrangler has a close encounter with an Eastern diamondback rattlesnake.

On the other hand, this other guy is trying to show that rattlesnakes should be killed when spotted. He even demonstrated the best way to do it, which is with your bare hands."
"All over the world, there are hundreds and thousands of companies that are actually hundreds or even thousands of years old. Whether its because of family tradition, great service, or their vital offerings, there’s no doubt these businesses have withstood the test of time.

Below, we list the five oldest companies in the world. We’re pretty sure they’ve got incredible tales to tell.

5. The Bingley Arms, England, Founded 953 AD

The Bingley Arms, a public house in Bardsey, Leeds, England, was originally named The Priests Inn. It’s Britain’s oldest pub, with roots dating back to between 905 and 953 AD. The place is said to have served as a safe house for persecuted Catholic priests, as well as a courthouse from which offenders were taken to the pillory across the road.

4. Sean’s Bar, Ireland, Founded 900 AD

This pub in Athlone, Ireland claims to be the oldest pub in the country. It was originally called Luain’s Inn, and it reportedly dates back to 900 AD. In the 2004 Guinness World Records, Sean’s Bar was listed as the oldest pub in Europe. During a renovation in 1970, the walls of the pub were found to be made of wattle and wicker, dating back to the 10th century. The bar still has records of every owner since its inception, including Boy George who owned it briefly in 1987.

3. Stiftskeller St. Peter, Austria, Founded 803 AD

Stiftskeller St. Peter, a restaurant within the monastery walls of St. Peter’s Archabbey, Salzburg, Austria, is said to be the oldest inn in Central Europe because it was supposedly mentioned by the scholar Alcuin in 803 AD. Based on this and other claims, it’s also considered one of the oldest restaurants in the world, and the oldest one in Europe. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Christopher Columbus are said to have dined here.

2. Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan, Japan, Founded 705 AD

This hot spring hotel in Hayakawa, Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan was founded in 705 AD. It is the oldest hotel and one of the oldest companies today. In 2011, Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan was officially listed by the Guinness World Records as the oldest hotel in the world. It has been operated by 52 generations of the same family since its inception.

1. Kongō Gumi Co., Ltd., Japan, Founded 578 AD

The Japanese construction company was the world’s oldest continuously ongoing independent company, operating for over 1,400 years, until it was made a subsidiary of Takamatsu in 2006. Located in Osaka, the once family-owned construction company has its origins dating to 578 AD. Over the centuries, Kongō Gumi helped in the construction of numerous famous buildings, including the 16th-century Osaka Castle. A three-meter 17th-century scroll traces the 40 generations back to the company’s beginnings."
"Momoka Kurita, a Japanese model, had men drooling over her when she attended a superbike racing event, the 48th MFJ Grand Prix, in 2016 as the “race queen.” With her beauty and her gorgeous body, anyone would easily be captivated by her looks and fantasize a date with her. But what most men, especially older men, didn’t know is that she was only 12-years-old that time.

Momoka’s beauty and body sparked controversy about the right age for girls to join the modeling industry. Some people believe that 12-year-old girls should not pose in sexy clothing and be part of an adult event.

One person commented:

“She’s cute, but dressing up an elementary student as a race queen is just wrong.”

Others even went on saying Momoka’s parents should have stopped her from getting involved in the industry at such a young age, but the teen said that nobody forced her to do modeling. Her parents have been nothing but supportive.

Momoka Kurita is a 13-year-old Japanese model.

She sparked controversy for attending a racing event dressed in sexy clothes.

People think Momoka is too young to participate in such event.

They believe that the modeling industry would rob off the teen's childhood.

Momoka is still an elementary student who’s taking up ballet lessons, piano, guitar and voice lessons, on top of her modeling classes. People believe that a modeling career would surely rob the teen of her childhood.



Momoka is pursuing her modeling career while also juggling school activities.

People may have criticized Momoka’s modeling career but she’s not letting it affect her. She still models for different brands and, at the same time, goes to school, according to Sora News 24.

She said no one is forcing her to do modeling.

And her parents support her as well.

She is currently auditioning for fashion event, Tokyo Girls Audition.

Do you think a 13-year-old girl is too young to model for an adult event? Sound off in the comments section below."
"Trees that line the parks in Maryland, particularly in Cecil County, are a beautiful sight to behold. Tourists just love how majestic they are and how lovely it feels to be close to nature when visiting the area. However, the tranquil beauty will suddenly be replaced with curiosity and a sense of morbidity as one takes a long walk amongst the trees. Out of all the parks found in the county, nothing can be creepier than Perryville Community Park.

Hundreds of these trees bear cryptic messages that are carved onto the barks. Over time, the carvings on the tree barks have grown in size, capturing the attention of anyone that happens to pass by, seemingly asking them to stop and look. The site that the trees grow on was once a part of Perry Point Veteran’s Administration Medical Center, a psychiatric and rehabilitation facility that catered mostly to U.S. military veterans.

During the patients’ time at the hospital, some of them walked the grounds and carved their marks, composed of disturbing thoughts, for everyone to discover today. Even though the carvings on trees became popular among those who like all things creepy, not many Maryland residents know about them, according to Cecil Daily.

The Perryville Community Park in Maryland is home to trees with eerie carvings.

The site is popular among tourists, especially those who like creepy things.

The site was once a hospital and psychiatric ward for U.S. military veterans.

Patients from decades ago walked and carved words and statements on the bark of the trees.

Carvings coming from people with disturbed thoughts would captivate tourists in the area.

One can find one-word carvings that are disturbing enough, including “Help” and “Murder.” Others carved military-associated words like “Armory” and “Infantry.” There are also religious inscriptions that say “All authority is given unto He in Heaven and Earth” and “The gate of heaven is open.”



The words ""The Killer,"" ""Murder"" and ""Police"" have been etched on the barks.

Some of the patients turned to the trees to make a confession, carving the statements, “Eddie Kenny did not want to murder George Norris but St. Ignacius made him” and “Monks didn’t want to murder Taylor Holly.”

The image of the classic mickey mouse can be seen in one of the trees.

""Christ said to police there was no Second World War""

The Perry Point was originally a general hospital that provided care for patients with various disabilities before it became a psychiatric ward in the 1920s. The Veterans Administration came into being in 1930.

"A video posted to Twitter by user @FishHiroto has gone viral and has earned some negative reactions. A number of online users said @FishHiroto inflicted cruelty on the squid featured on the video. In truth, however, @FishHiroto was performing ‘ikejime,’ a merciful way to kill the sea animal.

@FishHiroto‘s video was meant to show ikejime or ‘activity clamping.’ It’s a fishing technique in which a spike is driven into a fish’s brain to cause quick death.

Ikejime is a technique used to kill fish and is meant to cause quick death.

Most fish require only a single stab, but that’s not the case for a squid. To kill a squid, multiple stabs are needed to disable all motor functions. Such is shown in the video, where the first stab only affects half of the squid’s body.

Watch the video here:

Aside from being a more humane way to kill fish, ikejime also helps to preserve meat quality. Stress experienced by sea creatures before their death can negatively affect the taste and texture of their meat. Ikejime helps reduce, if not eliminate, that stress.

Ikejime is employed by experienced fishermen.

Users who are aware of the process came to @FishHiroto’s defense. One Twitter user said:

“This isn’t abuse at all. It’s more humane and even makes the meat better tasting.”

J-Cast News asked @FishHiroto for a comment. Here’s what he said:

“This is an ordinary thing among anglers, fishermen, and other experts of the sea. It’s sad that some people see this and think it’s ‘strange’ or ‘pitiful.’I don’t like people acting like their food comes out of thin air. I want everyone to know what kinds of things people are doing before it reaches their dinner table.”

Do you agree with what he said? What do you think of this technique?

"With the rising number of measles cases in the country, Germany is showing everyone how serious they are in combating the potentially fatal disease. In fact, the government has said that parents who fail or refuse to have their children vaccinated could face fines amounting up to $2,800.

In a BBC article, we learn that Health Minister Hermann Gröhe pointed out that this move was necessary “to tighten the law because of a measles epidemic.” Recently, a mother of three died because of measles.

So yes, it has come to a point where the government wants kindergartens to report parents who do not want their kids vaccinated.

With the rise of measles cases, Germany has deemed it necessary to fine parents if they refuse vaccination for their children.

As Gröhe told Bild, a local daily:

“Continuing deaths from measles cannot leave anyone indifferent.”

In addition to being fined, parents who fail to seek vaccination – or at least prove that their children are exempted from it due to medical reasons – could possibly be expelled from their daycare center.

This initiative is likewise facing some criticism as Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament, said that requiring kindergartens to report parents could be considered a breach of data protection laws.



Meanwhile, the World Health Organization websitee said that measles vaccine have saved about 1.7 lives since 2000. However, defeating the disease has taken a downward trend as several outbreaks in the United States were allegedly caused by unvaccinated children.

Lately, Germany has also been seeing an alarming increase in measles cases. A Robert Koch Institute report tells us that by mid-April of 2017, Germany already has a staggering 410 cases of measles as compared with the 325 for the entire 2016.

Vaccination has particularly become a controversial topic among parents and medical experts in recent years.

Some believe that it is important for saving children from potentially life-threatening diseases while others claim it causes autism."

"Privacy Policy

THE DOW JONES PRIVACY POLICY

Effective May 5, 2015

1. INTRODUCTION

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. and its affiliates (“Dow Jones”) want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you because we understand you are concerned about your privacy, and we want to maintain your trust.

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect from all sources including in connection with our websites, mobile sites, applications (“apps”), electronic newsletters and widgets (collectively the “Dow Jones Online Services”) that link to this Privacy Policy. If there is a conflict between this Policy and a Dow Jones Online Services corporate subscription agreement, the Dow Jones Online Services corporate subscription agreement will take precedence.

This Policy describes Dow Jones’ collection and use of users’ Personal Information. It also describes generally Dow Jones’ practices for handling Other Information (e.g., interests, demographics and services usage) collected through our Dow Jones Online Services or from a third party to the extent such information is associated with a particular device, user or user account. As described more fully below, we share information with our affiliated companies (“Dow Jones Affiliates”) for the purposes described in this privacy policy. A list of Dow Jones Affiliates is available here and in annual reports here. By using the Dow Jones Online Services or by providing personal information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

You may choose not to submit requested information online, or may choose to restrict the use of cookies (see Other Information below, or our Cookie Policy, for more information), but that may limit the services Dow Jones is able to provide to you.

The Dow Jones Online Services are a network of general audience sites, and are not targeted to, and do not knowingly collect Personal Information from, minors under 18 years of age. We request that these individuals do not provide Personal Information through the Dow Jones Online Services.

We may receive Personal Information about you from third parties, such as social media services, commercially available sources, Dow Jones Affiliates, business partners, and, if applicable to you, the third party provider of your subscription. The Personal Information we receive from third parties may include, for example, your name, contact information, information about your transactions, purchase history, or relationships with various product and service providers, and your use of certain applications. For example, if you access a Dow Jones Online Service through a social media service or connect a Dow Jones Online Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user name associated with that social media service, any information or content the social media service has the right to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends list, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Dow Jones Online Services through social media services or when you connect a Dow Jones Online Service to social media services, you are authorizing Dow Jones to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Third parties that support the Dow Jones Online Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as providing users with the ability to comment on content, allowing users to share content, customizing content based on usage, or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect Other Information on the Dow Jones Online Services and on other websites.

7. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Updates to Privacy Policy. Dow Jones may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Dow Jones Online Services. Your use of the Dow Jones Online Services or your provision of personal information to us following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.

Do Not Track Disclosure. Some browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. The Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups and regulators to develop a DNT browser technology standard to provide a common understanding as to how to interpret the DNT signals, but to date no standard has been adopted. Since there is no standard at this time, Dow Jones does not currently respond to DNT signals. Dow Jones will follow the progress of the W3C in developing the standard.

Location of Data. Your Personal Information may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using our products and services, you consent to the processing and transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.

Data Retention. We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.

Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service. In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment in such a case, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.

Linked Services. The Dow Jones Online Services may also be linked to sites operated by third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, special offers, functionality, games or applications developed and maintained by third parties. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Dow Jones logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. For example:

A portion of The Wall Street Journal Archive is hosted by an unrelated company – ProQuest – through its ProQuest Archiver service, and all article purchases are processed by ProQuest. ProQuest collects and uses your information in accordance with its privacy policy, and makes your information available to us. We will treat all information that ProQuest provides about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

The Portfolio feature is provided by a third party, NextCapital. NextCapital collects and uses your information in accordance with its privacy policy, which is separate from this one.

Dow Jones is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave the Dow Jones Online Services or click an advertisement, or sign up for a special offer, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.

Robert Franklin Robert could go on about how he was raised by honey badgers in the Texas Hill Country, or how he was elected to the Texas state legislature as a 19-year-old wunderkind, or how he won 219 consecutive games of Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots against Hugh Grant, but those would be lies. However, Robert does hail from Lewisville, Texas, having been transplanted from Fort Worth at a young age. Robert is a college student and focuses his studies on philosophical dilemmas involving morality, which he feels makes him very qualified to write about politicians. Reading the Bible turned Robert into an atheist, a combative disposition to greed turned him into a humanist, and the fact he has not lost a game of Madden football in over a decade has turned him into the Madden-winning equivalent of Zeus.

"Writing for Liberal America

We are always looking for talented freelance writers to cover the following topics:

Liberal and progressive politics

Exposing the hypocrisy of the religious right

Conservative/Republican fails

Life & Style articles that can be tied into a human interest or cultural angle

LGBT issues

Responsible gun solutions

Women’s rights

Immigration reform

Discrimination

Other news of interest to American liberals and progressives

Writer Requirements

Knowledge of WordPress or ability to learn WordPress on your own

Flawless grammar and spelling

Minimum of three articles per week, but you can write more than that if you want (with editor approval)

Native English fluency

Knowledge of the what’s going on in American politics and the issues facing Americans

We use Copyscape to check every work submitted. We are not interested in reprints of previously published work, though you can send this as a sample when you apply.

Story submissions after your first submission require approval by the editorial team.

Contractor Status

We work with freelance independent contractor writers. We do not withhold taxes (Social Security, Medicare, state taxes, etc…). We mail 1099s at the end of the year and you are responsible for reporting your income to the IRS.

Payment

Our pay structure is based on a revenue share model. We use 100% of the revenues that we receive from Google Adsense to pay our editorial team, specialized contract positions, and writers, with writers receiving 75 percent of the Adsense revenue earned from their articles.

Pay is directly tied to results, so our writers make anywhere from $50 to $7,000 per month, and it’s not unusual for writers to have viral articles that can make them a lot of money. While this was atypical and shouldn’t be an expectation, we did have one writer make $16,000 in one month last year. Our top writer made nearly $7,000 last month.

That said, Liberal America isn’t a get rich quick site. How much money you make depends on:

How often you write

How carefully you select story ideas, featured images, and headlines

How well you promote your articles.

We promote for you on our Facebook page of 670,000 fans, but any promotion beyond that is your responsibility. We do provide tips and recommendation. If you have access to a big Facebook page or Twitter account, you can quickly grow your views and your own personal fan-base.

Serious Writers Only

Writing for us is a great way to earn extra cash and grow your own audience as a writer. You are welcome to link to your own sites, books, social media accounts, etc…in your bio, which is shown on all articles by default.

Note that we are looking for serious writers who treat writing like a job, not occasional contributors or hobby bloggers. We require a minimum of three articles per week, but our writers who do very well write three to six articles per day.

How to Apply

Review our site to get a feel for what we write and our unique style.

Send a brief writing sample (pasted in the body of an email) or a link to a previously published work that you think is similar in style to ours to [email protected] .

Your sample can be something you’ve already written or a link to your web-published work. It doesn’t necessarily have to be political, but writers with experience writing in our style will be given special consideration"

Robert Franklin Robert could go on about how he was raised by honey badgers in the Texas Hill Country, or how he was elected to the Texas state legislature as a 19-year-old wunderkind, or how he won 219 consecutive games of Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots against Hugh Grant, but those would be lies. However, Robert does hail from Lewisville, Texas, having been transplanted from Fort Worth at a young age. Robert is a college student and focuses his studies on philosophical dilemmas involving morality, which he feels makes him very qualified to write about politicians. Reading the Bible turned Robert into an atheist, a combative disposition to greed turned him into a humanist, and the fact he has not lost a game of Madden football in over a decade has turned him into the Madden-winning equivalent of Zeus.

What if I told you that a right-wing radio host openly declared that “white power” was the only thing that keeps this country going? You’d probably wonder how he was still on the air. Well, what if I told you that host was a member of one of the most exclusive clubs in this country? Specifically, a black conservative who has bowed down to Donald Trump.









It’s been amply established that the standards to get into this club aren’t all that high. After all, consider some of its members. There’s Mark Burns, the South Carolina pastor who declared Democrats were the enemy during his benediction at the Republican National Convention, and tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton in blackface. And there’s former reality TV star Omarosa, who declared during the campaign that the country would have to bow down to Trump if he won. After Trump’s upset victory, Omarosa became a public engagement adviser to Trump, and used that role to warn a reporter that the White House had dossiers on its critics.

But black conservative pastor Jesse Lee Peterson may have outdone them all on the Wednesday edition of his radio show. During the show’s third hour, he openly declared that whites were the only ones who keep this country going. People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch got a clip.

Roughly seven minutes into the show’s third hour, Peterson and his producer, James Hake, engaged in what started out as a boilerplate case of a right-wing host offering fawning praise to Trump. Peterson said that while he had believed from the start that Trump was going to make America great again, even he was surprised by how “the light that’s within him” would “expose the darkness” in both this country and the world. Not entirely surprising, since Peterson considers Trump to be a shining example of how a real man should act.









He then praised Trump for shoving Montenegrin Prime Minister Dusko Markovic at last weekend’s NATO summit. Most of the world saw this as yet another example of boorish, bullying behavior from Trump. Not Peterson.

“He goes overseas, and as those weaklings try to get in front of him during a photo shoot, he pushed them out of the way. Obama would have stood behind in the back, and Trump went up and just grabbed the guy and pushed him out of the way. He got out in front.”

To Peterson’s mind, Trump was telling the world, “I’m the baddest man in town! A new sheriff is in town!” Hake was also pleased by it, and wanted to get the video.

But then Peterson crossed the line from mere alternative facting to something more sinister.

“White power! White power! I’m loving it. I love good. I love the light, I love it. And it doesn’t matter the color of the person that the light is coming from. I love it. I rejoice when I see men and women stand up with the love of God operating through them, overcoming evil.”

Wait a minute. In one breath, Peterson praises “white power,” then says that the color of your skin doesn’t matter if the light is shining through you?

Peterson then said that for much of Obama’s presidency, he believed that God had “given up on us” as a nation. He and Hake recalled how Hillary “sailed” through a Fox News interview in 2014. Both Peterson and Hake believed at the time that Hillary’s momentum was almost unstoppable. But Peterson claimed that one night while he was praying, God told him, “Be cool, Trump is coming. I will send my son and he will save you.”

Hake then recalled that there were a lot of white millennials, like himself, who were enamored with Trump and were “willing to fight” for him. Peterson agreed, saying that it was “beautiful” to see whites–especially young whites–“finally standing up” by suporting Trump. At that point, he really went off the deep end.

“It’s so refreshing, because if white people give up completely, it’s over for the country. It’s the whites who make things happen. Blacks and Mexicans don’t make things happen.”

Hake allowed that “very few” minorities actually do anything. Peterson agreed, allowing that “one or two” minorities at most actually make an impact. Nonetheless, the message was unmistakable–people of color really don’t do anything worth mentioning.

It turns out that this isn’t the first time Peterson has spewed something along these lines. A week after Trump took office, he dropped by Steve Malzberg’s show and claimed that only a white man like Trump could solve the rampant crime problem in areas like Chicago. Watch here.

Peterson said–with a straight face–that black men can’t “clean up their own neighborhoods” and “put their own families back together.” Only a white man can do it.

Granted, we’ve learned not to expect much from Peterson. This is a man who thinks blacks were better off before the civil rights movement, and also believes businesses should be able to discriminate with impunity. But with this latest screed, Peterson was blowing a dog whistle into a megaphone. If Malzberg, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, or any other white right-winger were to say something like this, they’d be canceled before the next break.

You may recall that earlier in the spring, after I blasted Peterson for his outrageous defense of Bill O’Reilly, Hake invited me to call into Peterson’s show. But I threw that offer back at him after his boss claimed that people who divorce are “selfish” if they remarry while their kids are still living with them. As someone who fled a marriage to an emotionally abusive woman, I considered it insulting on a personal level. It amounted to victim shaming.

As far as Hake was concerned, that made me a coward.

You want to argue behind a screen. I'm not wasting time on a closed minded coward. Call jesse or go away. — James Anton Hake (@JamesAntonHake) May 15, 2017

This is coming from a man whose boss engages in rhetoric that has no place in civilized discourse. Victim shaming, out-and-out racism, the lot. And said boss is only willing to respond in a forum that he controls. That says it all, from where I’m sitting.

Despite vocal opposition from businesses, advisers, and prominent members of his own party, President Donald Trump announced today that he would take America out of the Paris Agreement. The historic climate deal was developed in 2015 and signed by over 190 nations. The U.S. now joins Nicaragua and Syria as the only nations within the United Nations not subject to the agreement.









Trump argued that his decision would “put American workers first.” He suggested that the Paris Agreement would hurt the American economy, especially the fossil fuel industry. `But Roberton Williams, director of academic programs for the nonpartisan environmental and energy analysis group Resources for the Future, said:

“[The jobs losses would be] noticeable, but small enough that you wouldn’t even see it in the numbers. And the reason for that is it’s really, the effect would be much more of a job shift, rather than a job gain or a job loss.”

Williams explained that while some industries would be hurt (like coal mining or oil production), other industries (like the renewable energy sector) would gain new jobs as America came into compliance with the agreement.

Trump’s decision will only deepen the growing rift between the U.S. and the rest of the world. Exiting the deal shows that the U.S. is unwilling to follow through on its promises, and will hurt America’s reputation on the world stage.

Just prior to Trump’s official announcement that he would take the U.S. out of the agreement, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said:

“Ignoring reality and leaving the Paris agreement could go down as one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our nation’s history, isolating the U.S. further after Trump’s shockingly bad European trip.”

The U.S. contributes more greenhouse gas emissions than any other nation except China. Climate scientists have warned that even with the passage of the Paris Agreement, average global temperatures are expected to rise by at least 2 degrees Celsius (about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Warming greater than that would lead to catastrophic flooding, drought, extinctions, refugee crises, and war.









Now that the U.S. is out of the deal and on track to completely eliminate its environmental protections, the painful effects of climate change will likely accelerate.

Some observers are more sanguine. They cite recent economic trends – namely, the falling cost of natural gas and renewables against the high cost of fossil fuels – as reason for optimism. In a recent interview with NBC, J. Timmons Roberts, an environmental studies professor at Brown University, said that the U.S. might meet its emissions reduction targets even in the absence of a binding agreement.

“I actually think we might meet our target. The technology is making the choices easier for people more quickly than expected.”

California and some other states have pledged to increase their environmental regulations in response to Trump removing the U.S. from the agreement.

In his comments, Trump did leave open the possibility of renegotiating the deal along lines that he finds more amenable. But it remains unclear what such a renegotiated deal would look like, or if such a deal is even possible.

Trump will have to wait until the end of 2019 to completely exit the deal. But he could accelerate the exit process by canceling the domestic climate treaty linked to the Paris Agreement.

By ending environmental protections in the U.S. and canceling America’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, Trump poses a true danger not only to the country, but to the world.

"You know the times they are a-changing when Exxon Mobil starts sticking up for the environment.

For nearly forty years, Exxon Mobil engaged in an expensive disinformation campaign to bury evidence of climate change the company had a role in contributing to through its activity.









Former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson is now our nation’s sixty-ninth Secretary of State at a time we have a blatant climate denier in the White House. Clearly in the struggle between transnational fossil fuel corporations and the Earth, the former appears the victor. Right?

Maybe not.

In a surprising turn of events Wednesday, Exxon Mobil shareholders cast a historic vote to compel the fossil fuel monolith to be more forthcoming about climate change’s impact on its business. This comes as President Donald Trump is reportedly prepared to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, the agreement nearly 200 countries signed to address global climate change.

At the company’s annual meeting at the Morton H. Meyerson symphony center in downtown Dallas, Texas, sixty-two percent of shareholders voted for the resolution, against Exxon’s management. This is up from last year’s thirty-eight percent vote.









The resolution, introduced by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, states:

“[The company] should analyze the impacts on Exxon Mobil’s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2-degree [C] target…This reporting should assess the resilience of the company’s full portfolio of reserves and resources through 2040 and beyond, and address the financial risks associated with such a scenario.”

Leading the vote was Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England. He said:

“Trump is acting contrary to Wall Street and the world’s largest investors. Climate change is a material financial risk and shareholders want to know how companies will manage the change to a low carbon economy.”

The vote forces Exxon Mobil to conduct an annual “stress test” to measure how climate change regulation and new technology affect oil assets.

Mason said:

“[The company’s board members] recognized the significance of the agreed international goals on climate change [in their other roles].”

Susan Avery, former president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Exxon Mobil board member, said:

“Clearly climate science is telling us get off fossil fuels as much as possible.”

Former CEO of Xerox and Exxon board member Ursula Burns had previously signed the Obama administration’s climate pledge. Board member and Merck chairman/CEO Kenneth Frazier also favors action addressing climate change.

Chief executive Darren Woods said:

“We believe the risks of climate change are serious and warrant action, thoughtful action. As a company we are taking action in many ways.”

He also stated Exxon was doing enough to address the impact of climate change and regulation on its business, and that the board was against the proposal.

He added:

“The board believes the company has adequately assessed the future impact of policy developments.”

New York comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli said:

“This is an unprecedented victory for investors in the fight to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of Exxon Mobil. The burden is now on Exxon Mobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously.”

Though he hasn’t yet been able to admit that he screwed up and typed the wrong thing when he sent out his midnight “covfefe” tweet, the vast majority of the world realizes that President Trump is a complete moron and isn’t capable of saying he made a mistake.









But now we have Trump supporters on Reddit claiming that “covfefe” is actually a secret anti-terror message Trump was sending to those in the know.

You may now shake your head and laugh uncontrollably.

Yes, Trump fans at Reddit’s /r/The_Donald site have been suggesting exactly what their savior was trying to convey, and they understand perfectly. Here’s some of the postings:

“Cov fe’fe means “I’ll stand up” translated from Arabic! The President God Emperor is giving us hope in troubled times!”

“Despite the negative media, I will stand up. Cov fe’fe means ‘I will stand up’ in Arabic. Trump never makes mistakes, you guys.”

“COVFEFE IS A MESSAGE IN ARABIC!”

Just to be perfectly clear, there is no word in Arabic that is even remotely similar to “covfefe,” not even if you break it up and spell it “cov fe’fe.” Apparently some of the simpletons who back the Donald got that idea from Google Translate.









But that didn’t deter the Trump faithful, who also had this to say about Trump’s inane Twitter babbling:

“26D chess!. He got everyone to cover the ‘covfefe scandal’ and once it is realized by the normies that he did actually mean something, they’ll be forced to cover that too! F*cking genius Trump!”

“So he wanted the media and the leftist retards to think he screwed up. He let them go on and on and on, while we just had a blast with it. That Magnificent Mad Man.”

Or perhaps you prefer this bit of incomprehension from another Trump acolyte: Trump is using Arabic to convert Muslims to his global cause to make America great again:

“He’s redpilling them in their own language!”

Personally, I prefer this explanation: Trump was sleepy, decided to send out a tweet, and then the drugs he takes kicked in and he drifted off. Because the thought that a man who can barely speak English learned Arabic (or learned ANYTHING) is simply beyond all belief.

So, Trumpkins, put that in your pipe and covfefe it.

While appearing on CNN Thursday morning to discuss President Trump’s plan to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, former Pennsylvania Senator and failed presidential candidate Rick Santorum proved why no one will ever take him seriously.









Santorum began by saying the president should use Twitter to promote his agenda instead of attacking the media, adding:

“If he wants to get on message then he needs to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord or maybe even a halfway measure.”

Former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm, who was also a guest, replied:

“No, no, no! There are 3.3 million people in America that are working in the clean energy industry. If you look at my state, there are almost 90,000 jobs in clean energy right now.”

To that very good factual point, Santorum responded:

“We have a fracking revolution. And it’s driving down the cost of our electricity.”

Yeah, a fracking revolution which is now causing increased seismic activity in places that have never before experienced such things. Not to mention the toxicity of the fluid used in fracking.









Again, Graholm used facts to make her case:

“Solar and wind are cheaper than coal. Right now, China is cancelling 107 of its coal plants because why? Solar and wind are cheaper than coal. Same in India.”

That’s when Santorum reached into his pocket and pulled out his stupid card, declaring:

“It’s not reliable, it’s not consistent.”

To that, Granholm could only exclaim:

“Oh my god!”

Here’s the truth, which Santorum neglects to understand or acknowledge: The sun is expected to last another 5 billion years. Life on earth will be around about another billion. That sounds pretty damn reliable and consistent to me.

"There are concerns that President Donald Trump is about to pull funding from Tibetans in exile for 2018. The worrying reports come at the same time that talks of a possible meeting between the Dalai Lama and Trump are also happening.









Sonam Dagpo, the Secretary for international relations has said:

“I am awaiting the official document as of now. There is a 24-hour time gap between here and Washington. Once it comes, then we will go through it. I have read reports but can’t react over that.”









The Shanghaiist also reported that the cuts would end a decade long policy to help Tibetans in exile – amounting to cutting millions of dollars. People have speculated that this could be because Trump is trying to win China’s favour. Lobsang Wangyal, a Tibetan exile suggested to the Times of India that Trump may think the move will ‘thaw’ relations with China. However about the proposed cuts he also said:

“The move is contrary to American ideals of freedom, equality, and justice. Time will tell if Trump’s policy is really in line with his ‘Make America Great Again’

While it is just a proposal at the moment, no one would be surprised if this administration really did cut Tibet’s funding to zero. They have after all voted to kick millions off healthcare by repealing Obamacare, as well as dropping meals for the elderly and poor school children. Compassion is something that the Dalai Lama and Trump clearly do not have in common.

The amazing thing about the Dalai Lama is that he is always happy and seemingly worry-free – not even the election of the inexperienced Donald Trump, to the most powerful role in the world, seemed to bother him in the slightest – not even the Pope is that holy.

Perhaps the Dalai Lama says it best with this Tweet:

Money and power attract friends. But it’s not you they’re friends with — just your money and power. Only affection brings genuine friends. — Dalai Lama (@DalaiLama) May 12, 2017

Nigel Farage is a person of interest into the FBI’s investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia.

Founder of the far-right United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and chief engineer of the disastrous Brexit vote, he was named earlier today. According to the Guardian:

“Sources with knowledge of the investigation said the former Ukip leader had raised the interest of FBI investigators because of his relationships with individuals connected to both the Trump campaign and Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder whom Farage visited in March.”

Farage has not as of yet been accused of any wrongdoing. The FBI label ‘person of interest’ only denotes that a given person might have information they are seeking. But with a UK election just days away, bitter divisions over Brexit look set to polarize even further.









Because Farage seems to be the focus of a lot of unwanted attention. Sources who spoke to the Guardian claimed that his connection to Trump first drew suspicion:

“One of the things the intelligence investigators have been looking at is points of contact and persons involved,” one source said. “If you triangulate Russia, WikiLeaks, Assange, and Trump associate the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage. He’s right in the middle of these relationships. He turns up over and over again. There’s a lot of attention being paid to him.”

The source also mentioned Farage’s links with Roger Stone, Trump’s long-time political adviser who has admitted being in contact with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker whom U.S. intelligence agencies believe to be a Kremlin agent.

Brexit Bro’s

Trump jumped into the Brexit debate back in March when he said:

“I think they (Britain) may leave the EU, yes, they’re having a lot of problems.”

Having correctly identified one of the possible outcomes of the referendum, he preceded to set out his reasoning in a typically robust way. He commented on the vote, insisted that he did not want to comment on the vote, then immediately commented on it again, saying:

“I think they may leave based on – I’m there a lot, I have a lot of investments in the UK and I will tell you that I think they may leave based on everything I’m hearing.”

Shortly after the results of the referendum came in Trump treated it as something of a personal victory.

They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2016

Time passed. Nobody called him that.

The Lies That Bind

His links to Farage are convoluted, to say the least.

Back in August 2016, Farage attended a Trump rally in Mississippi where he was introduced by Trump as:

“The man behind Brexit, and the man who led – brilliantly – the United Kingdom Independence Party, and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles.”

Farage’s message to the gathered faithful mirrored Trump’s own take on the political world; right-wing ambition fueled by populist anti-establishment rhetoric:

“We reached those people who’ve been let down by modern global corporatism. We reached those people who have never voted in their lives, but believed that by going out and voting for Brexit, they could take back control of their country, take back control of their borders, and get back their pride and self-respect.”

In October he was in St Louis, Missouri helping Trump prepare for a televised debate and was quick to defend Trump’s pussy grabbing comments. He refused to draw a distinction between male bravado and casual discussion of sexual assault opining that:

“Look, this is alpha male boasting. It’s the kind of thing, if we are being honest, that men do. They sit around and have a drink and they talk like this.”

It was Farage — and not British Prime Minster Theresa May — who was the first British politician to meet Donald Trump following his election victory. Which is hardly surprising considering how much the pair have in common. They both hold Russian President Vladimir Putin in the highest regard.

Indeed, in a 2014 interview Farage admitted that Putin was the man he admired most in the world.

Suspicious Minds

Despite having told assembled journalists he was only a “tourist” as he entered Trump Tower in November, he paid visits on at least two other occasions raising speculation that he had been given a new role advising on UK/US trade deals. Shortly after, Trump made it known that he would like to keep Farage close to his bosom.

Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016

The British government declined since it was, as The Guardian pointed out:

“Unprecedented for an incoming US president to ask a world leader to appoint an opposing party leader as ambassador, and the statement puts (Prime Minister) May in a difficult position.”

By January Farage had secured a lucrative deal with Fox News as a political commentator and was boasting that he was:

“Treated like a ‘rock star’ in the U.S.,” and that there was a “Huge temptation to up sticks and move to America.”









Conspiracy Theory

All of which sounds like one hell of a reward for simply agreeing with Trump on a number of key — yet ill-defined — policy matters. Still, at least it fits well within an easily observed pattern of behavior.

During the same week one-time French presidential hopeful and now soundly defeated fascist Marine Le Penn also paid a low-key, off the record visit to Trump Tower.

Far right French candidate Marine LePen is having coffee in Trump Tower right now. She wouldn’t say what she was doing there. h/t @srl pic.twitter.com/9YSC3e6Dl1 — Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) January 12, 2017

Le Penn declined to say whether she was there to see President-elect Donald Trump or not. The Trump team however, well aware of Le Penn’s financial dependence on Russian loans were quick to stamp out any rumors. They insisted that there would be:

“No meetings.”

Sean Spicer also jumped into the fray, re-tweeting a post by CNN’s Noah Gray.

.@seanspicer tells me Marine le Pen is NOT meeting w/ PEOTUS or anyone else from transition team. Adds “Trump Tower is open to the Public” — Noah Gray (@NoahGrayCNN) January 12, 2017

Still, unconfirmed reports suggested that the man to Ms. Le Pen’s right in the photo was Guido “George” Lombardi.

Lombardi has links to a number of right-wing European parties. He also works as an adviser for Mr. Trump. Not that Le Penn was the only far right Putin-linked fascist that team Trump courted.

As Liberal America reported last January:

“Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of Austria’s far-right FPÖ a party founded by former SS officers ( yes, actual honest to goodness, ethnic-cleansing, skulls-on-their-hats Nazis,) were treated as a welcome addition to Trump’s inner circle.”

What Lies Beneath

Of course, We have the denials.

Farage’s spokesman denied any contact with Russian officials, and described the Guardian’s questions about his activities as:

“Verging on the hysterical. Nigel has never been to Russia, let alone worked with their authorities.”

However, according to the Guardian:

“He did not respond to questions about whether Farage was aware of the FBI inquiry; had hired a lawyer in connection to the matter; or when Farage first met Trump.”

Furthermore:

“The spokesman also declined to comment on whether Farage had received compensation from the Russian state-backed media group RT for his media appearances. RT, which has featured Farage about three times over the last 18 months, also declined to comment, citing confidentiality.”

As has been noted, Russian president Vladimir Putin covets a weak and divided Europe. He has scored some victories over the past few years. Trump won the election. Unwitting dupe or active thrall he’s the guy sitting in the White House. The creation of a transatlantic alliance intent on turning the clock back to the 1930’s is real.

The alliance dreams of a world where people are hypnotized by the illusory magnificence of their own nationality. Of a world of Brexit where people sacrifice hard-won labor rights in exchange for watery promises of national purity. It is a world of Muslim bans, a place where people willingly give up rights in return for handfuls of placebos.

But mostly, it is a world of organized chaos, a world of nation-states and war. A world where the supra-national organizations capable of dealing with existential threats like climate change are dismantled and in their place, there is only the nation-state.

Warring, fractious, and above all, fascist.

Watch Farage gush over Trump’s magnificence.

It was a refrain Donald Trump used repeatedly during the 2016 campaign: If elected, he would “drain the swamp” and eliminate the old order in Washington where lobbyists and politicians scratch each others backs in exchange for money and favors.









But now, as president, it appears Trump has merely restocked the metaphorical swamp, and the new creatures that inhabit it also happen to be members of his administration.

Late Wednesday, President Trump granted ethics waivers to 17 of his top White House aides, including chief strategist Steve Bannon, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, along with four former lobbyists who are now members of the Trump team.

The pace of the ethics waivers is unprecedented. The 17 senior White House appointees have been granted ethics waivers in a mere four months time. In contrast, President Obama granted that same number of waivers to his top staff over the course of his eight years in office.

White House lawyers defended the waivers by saying they were justified because the administration’s “need for the covered employee’s services outweighs the concern” that the employees might put their own financial interests ahead of the interests of the country.









In the case of Conway, her waiver allows her to meet and communicate with former clients of her consulting firm, though the White House didn’t bother to explain how that was more important than Conway being able to make a buck while also receiving a salary paid for by taxpayers.

Bannon’s waiver will allow him to communicate with news organizations. Seeing as how Bannon is the former CEO of Breitbart News, this means Bannon can now coordinate strategy with right-wing websites and news networks as the administration continues their dissemination of propaganda to the masses.

White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the waivers keep “the president’s commitment to the American people to be transparent.” She added:

“The White House Counsel’s Office worked closely with all White House officials to avoid conflicts arising from their former places of employment or investment holdings. To the furthest extent possible, counsel worked with each staffer to recuse from conflicting conduct rather than being granted waivers, which has led to the limited number of waivers being issued.”

Drain the swamp? Trump is filling it to overflowing.

What if I told you that a right-wing radio host openly declared that “white power” was the only thing that keeps this country going? You’d probably wonder how he was still on the air. Well, what if I told you that host was a member of one of the most exclusive clubs in this country? Specifically, a black conservative who has bowed down to Donald Trump.









It’s been amply established that the standards to get into this club aren’t all that high. After all, consider some of its members. There’s Mark Burns, the South Carolina pastor who declared Democrats were the enemy during his benediction at the Republican National Convention, and tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton in blackface. And there’s former reality TV star Omarosa, who declared during the campaign that the country would have to bow down to Trump if he won. After Trump’s upset victory, Omarosa became a public engagement adviser to Trump, and used that role to warn a reporter that the White House had dossiers on its critics.

But black conservative pastor Jesse Lee Peterson may have outdone them all on the Wednesday edition of his radio show. During the show’s third hour, he openly declared that whites were the only ones who keep this country going. People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch got a clip.

Roughly seven minutes into the show’s third hour, Peterson and his producer, James Hake, engaged in what started out as a boilerplate case of a right-wing host offering fawning praise to Trump. Peterson said that while he had believed from the start that Trump was going to make America great again, even he was surprised by how “the light that’s within him” would “expose the darkness” in both this country and the world. Not entirely surprising, since Peterson considers Trump to be a shining example of how a real man should act.









He then praised Trump for shoving Montenegrin Prime Minister Dusko Markovic at last weekend’s NATO summit. Most of the world saw this as yet another example of boorish, bullying behavior from Trump. Not Peterson.

“He goes overseas, and as those weaklings try to get in front of him during a photo shoot, he pushed them out of the way. Obama would have stood behind in the back, and Trump went up and just grabbed the guy and pushed him out of the way. He got out in front.”

To Peterson’s mind, Trump was telling the world, “I’m the baddest man in town! A new sheriff is in town!” Hake was also pleased by it, and wanted to get the video.

But then Peterson crossed the line from mere alternative facting to something more sinister.

“White power! White power! I’m loving it. I love good. I love the light, I love it. And it doesn’t matter the color of the person that the light is coming from. I love it. I rejoice when I see men and women stand up with the love of God operating through them, overcoming evil.”

Wait a minute. In one breath, Peterson praises “white power,” then says that the color of your skin doesn’t matter if the light is shining through you?

Peterson then said that for much of Obama’s presidency, he believed that God had “given up on us” as a nation. He and Hake recalled how Hillary “sailed” through a Fox News interview in 2014. Both Peterson and Hake believed at the time that Hillary’s momentum was almost unstoppable. But Peterson claimed that one night while he was praying, God told him, “Be cool, Trump is coming. I will send my son and he will save you.”

Hake then recalled that there were a lot of white millennials, like himself, who were enamored with Trump and were “willing to fight” for him. Peterson agreed, saying that it was “beautiful” to see whites–especially young whites–“finally standing up” by suporting Trump. At that point, he really went off the deep end.

“It’s so refreshing, because if white people give up completely, it’s over for the country. It’s the whites who make things happen. Blacks and Mexicans don’t make things happen.”

Hake allowed that “very few” minorities actually do anything. Peterson agreed, allowing that “one or two” minorities at most actually make an impact. Nonetheless, the message was unmistakable–people of color really don’t do anything worth mentioning.

It turns out that this isn’t the first time Peterson has spewed something along these lines. A week after Trump took office, he dropped by Steve Malzberg’s show and claimed that only a white man like Trump could solve the rampant crime problem in areas like Chicago. Watch here.

Peterson said–with a straight face–that black men can’t “clean up their own neighborhoods” and “put their own families back together.” Only a white man can do it.

Granted, we’ve learned not to expect much from Peterson. This is a man who thinks blacks were better off before the civil rights movement, and also believes businesses should be able to discriminate with impunity. But with this latest screed, Peterson was blowing a dog whistle into a megaphone. If Malzberg, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, or any other white right-winger were to say something like this, they’d be canceled before the next break.

You may recall that earlier in the spring, after I blasted Peterson for his outrageous defense of Bill O’Reilly, Hake invited me to call into Peterson’s show. But I threw that offer back at him after his boss claimed that people who divorce are “selfish” if they remarry while their kids are still living with them. As someone who fled a marriage to an emotionally abusive woman, I considered it insulting on a personal level. It amounted to victim shaming.

As far as Hake was concerned, that made me a coward.

You want to argue behind a screen. I'm not wasting time on a closed minded coward. Call jesse or go away. — James Anton Hake (@JamesAntonHake) May 15, 2017

This is coming from a man whose boss engages in rhetoric that has no place in civilized discourse. Victim shaming, out-and-out racism, the lot. And said boss is only willing to respond in a forum that he controls. That says it all, from where I’m sitting.

Hake allowed that “very few” minorities actually do anything. Peterson agreed, allowing that “one or two” minorities at most actually make an impact. Nonetheless, the message was unmistakable–people of color really don’t do anything worth mentioning.

It turns out that this isn’t the first time Peterson has spewed something along these lines. A week after Trump took office, he dropped by Steve Malzberg’s show and claimed that only a white man like Trump could solve the rampant crime problem in areas like Chicago. Watch here.

Peterson said–with a straight face–that black men can’t “clean up their own neighborhoods” and “put their own families back together.” Only a white man can do it.

Granted, we’ve learned not to expect much from Peterson. This is a man who thinks blacks were better off before the civil rights movement, and also believes businesses should be able to discriminate with impunity. But with this latest screed, Peterson was blowing a dog whistle into a megaphone. If Malzberg, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, or any other white right-winger were to say something like this, they’d be canceled before the next break.

You may recall that earlier in the spring, after I blasted Peterson for his outrageous defense of Bill O’Reilly, Hake invited me to call into Peterson’s show. But I threw that offer back at him after his boss claimed that people who divorce are “selfish” if they remarry while their kids are still living with them. As someone who fled a marriage to an emotionally abusive woman, I considered it insulting on a personal level. It amounted to victim shaming.

As far as Hake was concerned, that made me a coward.

You want to argue behind a screen. I'm not wasting time on a closed minded coward. Call jesse or go away. — James Anton Hake (@JamesAntonHake) May 15, 2017

This is coming from a man whose boss engages in rhetoric that has no place in civilized discourse. Victim shaming, out-and-out racism, the lot. And said boss is only willing to respond in a forum that he controls. That says it all, from where I’m sitting.

Though he hasn’t yet been able to admit that he screwed up and typed the wrong thing when he sent out his midnight “covfefe” tweet, the vast majority of the world realizes that President Trump is a complete moron and isn’t capable of saying he made a mistake.









But now we have Trump supporters on Reddit claiming that “covfefe” is actually a secret anti-terror message Trump was sending to those in the know.

You may now shake your head and laugh uncontrollably.

Yes, Trump fans at Reddit’s /r/The_Donald site have been suggesting exactly what their savior was trying to convey, and they understand perfectly. Here’s some of the postings:

“Cov fe’fe means “I’ll stand up” translated from Arabic! The President God Emperor is giving us hope in troubled times!”

“Despite the negative media, I will stand up. Cov fe’fe means ‘I will stand up’ in Arabic. Trump never makes mistakes, you guys.”

“COVFEFE IS A MESSAGE IN ARABIC!”

Just to be perfectly clear, there is no word in Arabic that is even remotely similar to “covfefe,” not even if you break it up and spell it “cov fe’fe.” Apparently some of the simpletons who back the Donald got that idea from Google Translate.









But that didn’t deter the Trump faithful, who also had this to say about Trump’s inane Twitter babbling:

“26D chess!. He got everyone to cover the ‘covfefe scandal’ and once it is realized by the normies that he did actually mean something, they’ll be forced to cover that too! F*cking genius Trump!”

“So he wanted the media and the leftist retards to think he screwed up. He let them go on and on and on, while we just had a blast with it. That Magnificent Mad Man.”

Or perhaps you prefer this bit of incomprehension from another Trump acolyte: Trump is using Arabic to convert Muslims to his global cause to make America great again:

“He’s redpilling them in their own language!”

Personally, I prefer this explanation: Trump was sleepy, decided to send out a tweet, and then the drugs he takes kicked in and he drifted off. Because the thought that a man who can barely speak English learned Arabic (or learned ANYTHING) is simply beyond all belief.

So, Trumpkins, put that in your pipe and covfefe it.

While appearing on CNN Thursday morning to discuss President Trump’s plan to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, former Pennsylvania Senator and failed presidential candidate Rick Santorum proved why no one will ever take him seriously.









Santorum began by saying the president should use Twitter to promote his agenda instead of attacking the media, adding:

“If he wants to get on message then he needs to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord or maybe even a halfway measure.”

Former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm, who was also a guest, replied:

“No, no, no! There are 3.3 million people in America that are working in the clean energy industry. If you look at my state, there are almost 90,000 jobs in clean energy right now.”

To that very good factual point, Santorum responded:

“We have a fracking revolution. And it’s driving down the cost of our electricity.”

Yeah, a fracking revolution which is now causing increased seismic activity in places that have never before experienced such things. Not to mention the toxicity of the fluid used in fracking.









Again, Graholm used facts to make her case:

“Solar and wind are cheaper than coal. Right now, China is cancelling 107 of its coal plants because why? Solar and wind are cheaper than coal. Same in India.”

That’s when Santorum reached into his pocket and pulled out his stupid card, declaring:

“It’s not reliable, it’s not consistent.”

To that, Granholm could only exclaim:

“Oh my god!”

Here’s the truth, which Santorum neglects to understand or acknowledge: The sun is expected to last another 5 billion years. Life on earth will be around about another billion. That sounds pretty damn reliable and consistent to me.

"There are concerns that President Donald Trump is about to pull funding from Tibetans in exile for 2018. The worrying reports come at the same time that talks of a possible meeting between the Dalai Lama and Trump are also happening.









Sonam Dagpo, the Secretary for international relations has said:

“I am awaiting the official document as of now. There is a 24-hour time gap between here and Washington. Once it comes, then we will go through it. I have read reports but can’t react over that.”









The Shanghaiist also reported that the cuts would end a decade long policy to help Tibetans in exile – amounting to cutting millions of dollars. People have speculated that this could be because Trump is trying to win China’s favour. Lobsang Wangyal, a Tibetan exile suggested to the Times of India that Trump may think the move will ‘thaw’ relations with China. However about the proposed cuts he also said:

“The move is contrary to American ideals of freedom, equality, and justice. Time will tell if Trump’s policy is really in line with his ‘Make America Great Again’

While it is just a proposal at the moment, no one would be surprised if this administration really did cut Tibet’s funding to zero. They have after all voted to kick millions off healthcare by repealing Obamacare, as well as dropping meals for the elderly and poor school children. Compassion is something that the Dalai Lama and Trump clearly do not have in common.

The amazing thing about the Dalai Lama is that he is always happy and seemingly worry-free – not even the election of the inexperienced Donald Trump, to the most powerful role in the world, seemed to bother him in the slightest – not even the Pope is that holy.

Perhaps the Dalai Lama says it best with this Tweet:

Money and power attract friends. But it’s not you they’re friends with — just your money and power. Only affection brings genuine friends. — Dalai Lama (@DalaiLama) May 12, 2017

Nigel Farage is a person of interest into the FBI’s investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia.

Founder of the far-right United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and chief engineer of the disastrous Brexit vote, he was named earlier today. According to the Guardian:

“Sources with knowledge of the investigation said the former Ukip leader had raised the interest of FBI investigators because of his relationships with individuals connected to both the Trump campaign and Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder whom Farage visited in March.”

Farage has not as of yet been accused of any wrongdoing. The FBI label ‘person of interest’ only denotes that a given person might have information they are seeking. But with a UK election just days away, bitter divisions over Brexit look set to polarize even further.









Because Farage seems to be the focus of a lot of unwanted attention. Sources who spoke to the Guardian claimed that his connection to Trump first drew suspicion:

“One of the things the intelligence investigators have been looking at is points of contact and persons involved,” one source said. “If you triangulate Russia, WikiLeaks, Assange, and Trump associate the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage. He’s right in the middle of these relationships. He turns up over and over again. There’s a lot of attention being paid to him.”

The source also mentioned Farage’s links with Roger Stone, Trump’s long-time political adviser who has admitted being in contact with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker whom U.S. intelligence agencies believe to be a Kremlin agent.

Brexit Bro’s

Trump jumped into the Brexit debate back in March when he said:

“I think they (Britain) may leave the EU, yes, they’re having a lot of problems.”

Having correctly identified one of the possible outcomes of the referendum, he preceded to set out his reasoning in a typically robust way. He commented on the vote, insisted that he did not want to comment on the vote, then immediately commented on it again, saying:

“I think they may leave based on – I’m there a lot, I have a lot of investments in the UK and I will tell you that I think they may leave based on everything I’m hearing.”

Shortly after the results of the referendum came in Trump treated it as something of a personal victory.

They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2016

Time passed. Nobody called him that.

The Lies That Bind

His links to Farage are convoluted, to say the least.

Back in August 2016, Farage attended a Trump rally in Mississippi where he was introduced by Trump as:

“The man behind Brexit, and the man who led – brilliantly – the United Kingdom Independence Party, and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles.”

Farage’s message to the gathered faithful mirrored Trump’s own take on the political world; right-wing ambition fueled by populist anti-establishment rhetoric:

“We reached those people who’ve been let down by modern global corporatism. We reached those people who have never voted in their lives, but believed that by going out and voting for Brexit, they could take back control of their country, take back control of their borders, and get back their pride and self-respect.”

In October he was in St Louis, Missouri helping Trump prepare for a televised debate and was quick to defend Trump’s pussy grabbing comments. He refused to draw a distinction between male bravado and casual discussion of sexual assault opining that:

“Look, this is alpha male boasting. It’s the kind of thing, if we are being honest, that men do. They sit around and have a drink and they talk like this.”

It was Farage — and not British Prime Minster Theresa May — who was the first British politician to meet Donald Trump following his election victory. Which is hardly surprising considering how much the pair have in common. They both hold Russian President Vladimir Putin in the highest regard.

Indeed, in a 2014 interview Farage admitted that Putin was the man he admired most in the world.

Suspicious Minds

Despite having told assembled journalists he was only a “tourist” as he entered Trump Tower in November, he paid visits on at least two other occasions raising speculation that he had been given a new role advising on UK/US trade deals. Shortly after, Trump made it known that he would like to keep Farage close to his bosom.

Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016

The British government declined since it was, as The Guardian pointed out:

“Unprecedented for an incoming US president to ask a world leader to appoint an opposing party leader as ambassador, and the statement puts (Prime Minister) May in a difficult position.”

By January Farage had secured a lucrative deal with Fox News as a political commentator and was boasting that he was:

“Treated like a ‘rock star’ in the U.S.,” and that there was a “Huge temptation to up sticks and move to America.”









Conspiracy Theory

All of which sounds like one hell of a reward for simply agreeing with Trump on a number of key — yet ill-defined — policy matters. Still, at least it fits well within an easily observed pattern of behavior.

During the same week one-time French presidential hopeful and now soundly defeated fascist Marine Le Penn also paid a low-key, off the record visit to Trump Tower.

Far right French candidate Marine LePen is having coffee in Trump Tower right now. She wouldn’t say what she was doing there. h/t @srl pic.twitter.com/9YSC3e6Dl1 — Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) January 12, 2017

Le Penn declined to say whether she was there to see President-elect Donald Trump or not. The Trump team however, well aware of Le Penn’s financial dependence on Russian loans were quick to stamp out any rumors. They insisted that there would be:

“No meetings.”

Sean Spicer also jumped into the fray, re-tweeting a post by CNN’s Noah Gray.

.@seanspicer tells me Marine le Pen is NOT meeting w/ PEOTUS or anyone else from transition team. Adds “Trump Tower is open to the Public” — Noah Gray (@NoahGrayCNN) January 12, 2017

Still, unconfirmed reports suggested that the man to Ms. Le Pen’s right in the photo was Guido “George” Lombardi.

Lombardi has links to a number of right-wing European parties. He also works as an adviser for Mr. Trump. Not that Le Penn was the only far right Putin-linked fascist that team Trump courted.

As Liberal America reported last January:

“Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of Austria’s far-right FPÖ a party founded by former SS officers ( yes, actual honest to goodness, ethnic-cleansing, skulls-on-their-hats Nazis,) were treated as a welcome addition to Trump’s inner circle.”

What Lies Beneath

Of course, We have the denials.

Farage’s spokesman denied any contact with Russian officials, and described the Guardian’s questions about his activities as:

“Verging on the hysterical. Nigel has never been to Russia, let alone worked with their authorities.”

However, according to the Guardian:

“He did not respond to questions about whether Farage was aware of the FBI inquiry; had hired a lawyer in connection to the matter; or when Farage first met Trump.”

Furthermore:

“The spokesman also declined to comment on whether Farage had received compensation from the Russian state-backed media group RT for his media appearances. RT, which has featured Farage about three times over the last 18 months, also declined to comment, citing confidentiality.”

As has been noted, Russian president Vladimir Putin covets a weak and divided Europe. He has scored some victories over the past few years. Trump won the election. Unwitting dupe or active thrall he’s the guy sitting in the White House. The creation of a transatlantic alliance intent on turning the clock back to the 1930’s is real.

The alliance dreams of a world where people are hypnotized by the illusory magnificence of their own nationality. Of a world of Brexit where people sacrifice hard-won labor rights in exchange for watery promises of national purity. It is a world of Muslim bans, a place where people willingly give up rights in return for handfuls of placebos.

But mostly, it is a world of organized chaos, a world of nation-states and war. A world where the supra-national organizations capable of dealing with existential threats like climate change are dismantled and in their place, there is only the nation-state.

Warring, fractious, and above all, fascist.

Watch Farage gush over Trump’s magnificence.

“I think they may leave based on – I’m there a lot, I have a lot of investments in the UK and I will tell you that I think they may leave based on everything I’m hearing.”

Shortly after the results of the referendum came in Trump treated it as something of a personal victory.

They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2016

Time passed. Nobody called him that.

The Lies That Bind

His links to Farage are convoluted, to say the least.

Back in August 2016, Farage attended a Trump rally in Mississippi where he was introduced by Trump as:

“The man behind Brexit, and the man who led – brilliantly – the United Kingdom Independence Party, and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles.”

Farage’s message to the gathered faithful mirrored Trump’s own take on the political world; right-wing ambition fueled by populist anti-establishment rhetoric:

“We reached those people who’ve been let down by modern global corporatism. We reached those people who have never voted in their lives, but believed that by going out and voting for Brexit, they could take back control of their country, take back control of their borders, and get back their pride and self-respect.”

In October he was in St Louis, Missouri helping Trump prepare for a televised debate and was quick to defend Trump’s pussy grabbing comments. He refused to draw a distinction between male bravado and casual discussion of sexual assault opining that:

“Look, this is alpha male boasting. It’s the kind of thing, if we are being honest, that men do. They sit around and have a drink and they talk like this.”

It was Farage — and not British Prime Minster Theresa May — who was the first British politician to meet Donald Trump following his election victory. Which is hardly surprising considering how much the pair have in common. They both hold Russian President Vladimir Putin in the highest regard.

Indeed, in a 2014 interview Farage admitted that Putin was the man he admired most in the world.

Suspicious Minds

Despite having told assembled journalists he was only a “tourist” as he entered Trump Tower in November, he paid visits on at least two other occasions raising speculation that he had been given a new role advising on UK/US trade deals. Shortly after, Trump made it known that he would like to keep Farage close to his bosom.

Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016

The British government declined since it was, as The Guardian pointed out:

“Unprecedented for an incoming US president to ask a world leader to appoint an opposing party leader as ambassador, and the statement puts (Prime Minister) May in a difficult position.”

By January Farage had secured a lucrative deal with Fox News as a political commentator and was boasting that he was:

“Treated like a ‘rock star’ in the U.S.,” and that there was a “Huge temptation to up sticks and move to America.”









Conspiracy Theory

All of which sounds like one hell of a reward for simply agreeing with Trump on a number of key — yet ill-defined — policy matters. Still, at least it fits well within an easily observed pattern of behavior.

During the same week one-time French presidential hopeful and now soundly defeated fascist Marine Le Penn also paid a low-key, off the record visit to Trump Tower.

Far right French candidate Marine LePen is having coffee in Trump Tower right now. She wouldn’t say what she was doing there. h/t @srl pic.twitter.com/9YSC3e6Dl1 — Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) January 12, 2017

Le Penn declined to say whether she was there to see President-elect Donald Trump or not. The Trump team however, well aware of Le Penn’s financial dependence on Russian loans were quick to stamp out any rumors. They insisted that there would be:

“No meetings.”

Sean Spicer also jumped into the fray, re-tweeting a post by CNN’s Noah Gray.

.@seanspicer tells me Marine le Pen is NOT meeting w/ PEOTUS or anyone else from transition team. Adds “Trump Tower is open to the Public” — Noah Gray (@NoahGrayCNN) January 12, 2017

Still, unconfirmed reports suggested that the man to Ms. Le Pen’s right in the photo was Guido “George” Lombardi.

Lombardi has links to a number of right-wing European parties. He also works as an adviser for Mr. Trump. Not that Le Penn was the only far right Putin-linked fascist that team Trump courted.

As Liberal America reported last January:

“Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of Austria’s far-right FPÖ a party founded by former SS officers ( yes, actual honest to goodness, ethnic-cleansing, skulls-on-their-hats Nazis,) were treated as a welcome addition to Trump’s inner circle.”

What Lies Beneath

Of course, We have the denials.

Farage’s spokesman denied any contact with Russian officials, and described the Guardian’s questions about his activities as:

“Verging on the hysterical. Nigel has never been to Russia, let alone worked with their authorities.”

However, according to the Guardian:

“He did not respond to questions about whether Farage was aware of the FBI inquiry; had hired a lawyer in connection to the matter; or when Farage first met Trump.”

Furthermore:

“The spokesman also declined to comment on whether Farage had received compensation from the Russian state-backed media group RT for his media appearances. RT, which has featured Farage about three times over the last 18 months, also declined to comment, citing confidentiality.”

As has been noted, Russian president Vladimir Putin covets a weak and divided Europe. He has scored some victories over the past few years. Trump won the election. Unwitting dupe or active thrall he’s the guy sitting in the White House. The creation of a transatlantic alliance intent on turning the clock back to the 1930’s is real.

The alliance dreams of a world where people are hypnotized by the illusory magnificence of their own nationality. Of a world of Brexit where people sacrifice hard-won labor rights in exchange for watery promises of national purity. It is a world of Muslim bans, a place where people willingly give up rights in return for handfuls of placebos.

But mostly, it is a world of organized chaos, a world of nation-states and war. A world where the supra-national organizations capable of dealing with existential threats like climate change are dismantled and in their place, there is only the nation-state.

Warring, fractious, and above all, fascist.

Watch Farage gush over Trump’s magnificence.

It was a refrain Donald Trump used repeatedly during the 2016 campaign: If elected, he would “drain the swamp” and eliminate the old order in Washington where lobbyists and politicians scratch each others backs in exchange for money and favors.









But now, as president, it appears Trump has merely restocked the metaphorical swamp, and the new creatures that inhabit it also happen to be members of his administration.

Late Wednesday, President Trump granted ethics waivers to 17 of his top White House aides, including chief strategist Steve Bannon, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, along with four former lobbyists who are now members of the Trump team.

The pace of the ethics waivers is unprecedented. The 17 senior White House appointees have been granted ethics waivers in a mere four months time. In contrast, President Obama granted that same number of waivers to his top staff over the course of his eight years in office.

White House lawyers defended the waivers by saying they were justified because the administration’s “need for the covered employee’s services outweighs the concern” that the employees might put their own financial interests ahead of the interests of the country.









In the case of Conway, her waiver allows her to meet and communicate with former clients of her consulting firm, though the White House didn’t bother to explain how that was more important than Conway being able to make a buck while also receiving a salary paid for by taxpayers.

Bannon’s waiver will allow him to communicate with news organizations. Seeing as how Bannon is the former CEO of Breitbart News, this means Bannon can now coordinate strategy with right-wing websites and news networks as the administration continues their dissemination of propaganda to the masses.

White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the waivers keep “the president’s commitment to the American people to be transparent.” She added:

“The White House Counsel’s Office worked closely with all White House officials to avoid conflicts arising from their former places of employment or investment holdings. To the furthest extent possible, counsel worked with each staffer to recuse from conflicting conduct rather than being granted waivers, which has led to the limited number of waivers being issued.”

Drain the swamp? Trump is filling it to overflowing.

What if I told you that a right-wing radio host openly declared that “white power” was the only thing that keeps this country going? You’d probably wonder how he was still on the air. Well, what if I told you that host was a member of one of the most exclusive clubs in this country? Specifically, a black conservative who has bowed down to Donald Trump.









It’s been amply established that the standards to get into this club aren’t all that high. After all, consider some of its members. There’s Mark Burns, the South Carolina pastor who declared Democrats were the enemy during his benediction at the Republican National Convention, and tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton in blackface. And there’s former reality TV star Omarosa, who declared during the campaign that the country would have to bow down to Trump if he won. After Trump’s upset victory, Omarosa became a public engagement adviser to Trump, and used that role to warn a reporter that the White House had dossiers on its critics.

But black conservative pastor Jesse Lee Peterson may have outdone them all on the Wednesday edition of his radio show. During the show’s third hour, he openly declared that whites were the only ones who keep this country going. People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch got a clip.

Roughly seven minutes into the show’s third hour, Peterson and his producer, James Hake, engaged in what started out as a boilerplate case of a right-wing host offering fawning praise to Trump. Peterson said that while he had believed from the start that Trump was going to make America great again, even he was surprised by how “the light that’s within him” would “expose the darkness” in both this country and the world. Not entirely surprising, since Peterson considers Trump to be a shining example of how a real man should act.









He then praised Trump for shoving Montenegrin Prime Minister Dusko Markovic at last weekend’s NATO summit. Most of the world saw this as yet another example of boorish, bullying behavior from Trump. Not Peterson.

“He goes overseas, and as those weaklings try to get in front of him during a photo shoot, he pushed them out of the way. Obama would have stood behind in the back, and Trump went up and just grabbed the guy and pushed him out of the way. He got out in front.”

To Peterson’s mind, Trump was telling the world, “I’m the baddest man in town! A new sheriff is in town!” Hake was also pleased by it, and wanted to get the video.

But then Peterson crossed the line from mere alternative facting to something more sinister.

“White power! White power! I’m loving it. I love good. I love the light, I love it. And it doesn’t matter the color of the person that the light is coming from. I love it. I rejoice when I see men and women stand up with the love of God operating through them, overcoming evil.”

Wait a minute. In one breath, Peterson praises “white power,” then says that the color of your skin doesn’t matter if the light is shining through you?

Peterson then said that for much of Obama’s presidency, he believed that God had “given up on us” as a nation. He and Hake recalled how Hillary “sailed” through a Fox News interview in 2014. Both Peterson and Hake believed at the time that Hillary’s momentum was almost unstoppable. But Peterson claimed that one night while he was praying, God told him, “Be cool, Trump is coming. I will send my son and he will save you.”

Hake then recalled that there were a lot of white millennials, like himself, who were enamored with Trump and were “willing to fight” for him. Peterson agreed, saying that it was “beautiful” to see whites–especially young whites–“finally standing up” by suporting Trump. At that point, he really went off the deep end.

“It’s so refreshing, because if white people give up completely, it’s over for the country. It’s the whites who make things happen. Blacks and Mexicans don’t make things happen.”

Hake allowed that “very few” minorities actually do anything. Peterson agreed, allowing that “one or two” minorities at most actually make an impact. Nonetheless, the message was unmistakable–people of color really don’t do anything worth mentioning.

It turns out that this isn’t the first time Peterson has spewed something along these lines. A week after Trump took office, he dropped by Steve Malzberg’s show and claimed that only a white man like Trump could solve the rampant crime problem in areas like Chicago. Watch here.

Peterson said–with a straight face–that black men can’t “clean up their own neighborhoods” and “put their own families back together.” Only a white man can do it.

Granted, we’ve learned not to expect much from Peterson. This is a man who thinks blacks were better off before the civil rights movement, and also believes businesses should be able to discriminate with impunity. But with this latest screed, Peterson was blowing a dog whistle into a megaphone. If Malzberg, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, or any other white right-winger were to say something like this, they’d be canceled before the next break.

You may recall that earlier in the spring, after I blasted Peterson for his outrageous defense of Bill O’Reilly, Hake invited me to call into Peterson’s show. But I threw that offer back at him after his boss claimed that people who divorce are “selfish” if they remarry while their kids are still living with them. As someone who fled a marriage to an emotionally abusive woman, I considered it insulting on a personal level. It amounted to victim shaming.

As far as Hake was concerned, that made me a coward.

You want to argue behind a screen. I'm not wasting time on a closed minded coward. Call jesse or go away. — James Anton Hake (@JamesAntonHake) May 15, 2017

This is coming from a man whose boss engages in rhetoric that has no place in civilized discourse. Victim shaming, out-and-out racism, the lot. And said boss is only willing to respond in a forum that he controls. That says it all, from where I’m sitting.

President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget makes dramatic cuts to what little remains of the social safety net. If the budget is approved, many will suffer. But Native Americans will be among those hit hardest by the budget’s extreme austerity.









To really understand the abject cruelty of this budget, you have to understand that tribal communities are already living on the edge. Thanks to the systematic repression of native culture, Native American languages are all but extinct. Native youth are almost twice as likely as average American youth to commit suicide. And one in four Native Americans is living in poverty.

The Trump budget does nothing to improve these metrics. Some two million Native Americans receive health care and other services from the Bureau of Indian affairs, an agency within the Interior Department. But Trump’s budget proposal slashes Interior Department funding by 12 percent. That translates to cuts of:

• $64 million for Native American education

• $21 million for reservation law enforcement and safety

• $27 million for natural resources management programs run by tribes

• $23 million from human services

Money for law enforcement is especially important to ensure local safety. The Oglala Sioux tribe’s police budget, for instance, currently supports just 44 officers who are charged with covering a reservation that sprawls 3,468 square miles. That’s an area slightly less than the size of three Rhode Islands.









Tribal education would suffer under the White House budget. One of the deepest cuts to Native American budgets would be the elimination of $1.2 billion in grants for after-school and summer programs. Robert Brave Heart Sr., the executive vice president of Red Cloud Indian School on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, said the Trump administration’s plan would hurt his students. Other cuts to service programs like Americorps would make it more difficult for Indian schools to afford teachers and even bus drivers.

Native American communities would also be hurt by cuts to climate change programs. Trump has called climate change a hoax and installed avowed climate deniers to head many government agencies. But Native tribes, especially those in the Pacific Northwest, consider climate resiliency programs important. Carina Miller, a councilwoman with Oregon’s Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, explained:

“The reality is, is that’s how we lived. The indigenous way of thinking is you’re stewards of the land.”

Mason Big Crow, treasurer of the Oglala Sioux tribe, said his tribe stands to lose at least half of the money it currently receives from federal funds. According to Mel Sheldon, a councilman with the Tulalip Tribes in Washington state:

“This is the single largest attack on Indian Country that we’ve experienced in recent history. There is no doubt that the president has made a statement toward Indian County. It is not a good statement.”

Even the casual student of U.S. history knows that Native Americans have been cheated out of their land, lied to, and brutally massacred throughout much of American history. The Trump budget, if approved, will only perpetuate this mistreatment.

In some good news, a push for less discrimination and equality for the LGBTQ has had a win in Oregon. The Governor Kate Brown of Oregon signed a Transgender equality bill and has said the government has no place in “…Dictating personal identity.”

The bill, HB 2673, has been put in place to make it easier for Transgender people who wish to amend their birth certificates and other identity certificates so they state the same gender they identify with.









This is a matter that many non-transgender people might not consider as a difficulty that accompanies being transgender. Imagine feeling you were born in the wrong body and the discrimination that comes with it. Then imagine a situation where you are asked to prove your identity and the only document you can produce does not reflect who you are. It might even add ammunition to the people who may be discriminating against you. This new bill allows transgender people the dignity and ability to attain papers that are aligned with who they are much more easily.









Transgender people are discriminated against in many ways, in the workplace, socially, and they are even murdered at higher rates. This is unacceptable and any bill that pushes for the protection of this community, is a compassionate and worthy one. With this bill and thanks to Gov. Kate Brown, Transgender people can now apply for their amended identification documents in a more affordable and simpler way.

JoDee Winterhof of Human Rights Campaign(HRC) reacted with this statement:

‘By signing this legislation into law, Governor Kate Brown is helping to make Oregon an even more inviting and inclusive place for transgender people to call home. We congratulate Basic Rights Oregon on this important victory and thank Governor Brown for her continued outstanding leadership on LGBTQ equality.’

In a tweet the Governor herself said this:

At a time where the White House is moving to take away protections from the Transgender community, this is welcome, good news.

It is also evidence that progressive policies can be achieved at local levels.

One of the key components of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was the guarantee that women would be able to obtain contraceptive care without having to pay for it. Recognizing that pregnancy and birth cost far more than birth control, the ACA made it mandatory for every employer to provide birth control as part of its health insurance plan for employees.









Of course there was a reaction, and push back against this mandate. Some religious organizations claimed that providing birth control was contrary to their religious beliefs.









OK, said President Obama and the other authors of the ACA. If an organization wanted to opt out of the mandate on religious or moral grounds, all they had to do was to file a request with the government to do so.

Those church folks were not happy with this. They claimed that if they filed a request for a waiver, the government might find another way to provide this health care option to their employees. So they sued.

They claimed that forcing them to provide (or even help to provide) birth control to their employees was a violation of their religious freedom.

Never mind the fact that denying that right to those who work for them was a violation of their right to healthcare. These uber religious folk demanded that they be allowed to simply deny employees a basic insurance benefit.

The Obama administration kept fighting this battle.

But now we have Trump.

Now we have a man who care so little for women and their right to have control of their own bodies, that he is in the process of rolling back the ACA mandate. He is proposing a change to the law that would allow any and all employers to opt out of covering birth control.

No one would have to file a request with the government claiming religious rights. No employer would have to justify the reasons why they have decided to deny women employees the right to have no cost birth control.

In case you were wondering whether or not Donald Trump and his administration is completely misogynistic, this is the proof that you need.

One of the key components of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was the guarantee that women would be able to obtain contraceptive care without having to pay for it. Recognizing that pregnancy and birth cost far more than birth control, the ACA made it mandatory for every employer to provide birth control as part of its health insurance plan for employees.









Of course there was a reaction, and push back against this mandate. Some religious organizations claimed that providing birth control was contrary to their religious beliefs.









OK, said President Obama and the other authors of the ACA. If an organization wanted to opt out of the mandate on religious or moral grounds, all they had to do was to file a request with the government to do so.

Despite vocal opposition from businesses, advisers, and prominent members of his own party, President Donald Trump announced today that he would take America out of the Paris Agreement. The historic climate deal was developed in 2015 and signed by over 190 nations. The U.S. now joins Nicaragua and Syria as the only nations within the United Nations not subject to the agreement.









Trump argued that his decision would “put American workers first.” He suggested that the Paris Agreement would hurt the American economy, especially the fossil fuel industry. `But Roberton Williams, director of academic programs for the nonpartisan environmental and energy analysis group Resources for the Future, said:

“[The jobs losses would be] noticeable, but small enough that you wouldn’t even see it in the numbers. And the reason for that is it’s really, the effect would be much more of a job shift, rather than a job gain or a job loss.”

Williams explained that while some industries would be hurt (like coal mining or oil production), other industries (like the renewable energy sector) would gain new jobs as America came into compliance with the agreement.

Trump’s decision will only deepen the growing rift between the U.S. and the rest of the world. Exiting the deal shows that the U.S. is unwilling to follow through on its promises, and will hurt America’s reputation on the world stage.

Just prior to Trump’s official announcement that he would take the U.S. out of the agreement, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said:

“Ignoring reality and leaving the Paris agreement could go down as one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our nation’s history, isolating the U.S. further after Trump’s shockingly bad European trip.”

The U.S. contributes more greenhouse gas emissions than any other nation except China. Climate scientists have warned that even with the passage of the Paris Agreement, average global temperatures are expected to rise by at least 2 degrees Celsius (about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Warming greater than that would lead to catastrophic flooding, drought, extinctions, refugee crises, and war.









Now that the U.S. is out of the deal and on track to completely eliminate its environmental protections, the painful effects of climate change will likely accelerate.

Some observers are more sanguine. They cite recent economic trends – namely, the falling cost of natural gas and renewables against the high cost of fossil fuels – as reason for optimism. In a recent interview with NBC, J. Timmons Roberts, an environmental studies professor at Brown University, said that the U.S. might meet its emissions reduction targets even in the absence of a binding agreement.

“I actually think we might meet our target. The technology is making the choices easier for people more quickly than expected.”

California and some other states have pledged to increase their environmental regulations in response to Trump removing the U.S. from the agreement.

In his comments, Trump did leave open the possibility of renegotiating the deal along lines that he finds more amenable. But it remains unclear what such a renegotiated deal would look like, or if such a deal is even possible.

Trump will have to wait until the end of 2019 to completely exit the deal. But he could accelerate the exit process by canceling the domestic climate treaty linked to the Paris Agreement.

By ending environmental protections in the U.S. and canceling America’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, Trump poses a true danger not only to the country, but to the world.

"You know the times they are a-changing when Exxon Mobil starts sticking up for the environment.

For nearly forty years, Exxon Mobil engaged in an expensive disinformation campaign to bury evidence of climate change the company had a role in contributing to through its activity.









Former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson is now our nation’s sixty-ninth Secretary of State at a time we have a blatant climate denier in the White House. Clearly in the struggle between transnational fossil fuel corporations and the Earth, the former appears the victor. Right?

Maybe not.

In a surprising turn of events Wednesday, Exxon Mobil shareholders cast a historic vote to compel the fossil fuel monolith to be more forthcoming about climate change’s impact on its business. This comes as President Donald Trump is reportedly prepared to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, the agreement nearly 200 countries signed to address global climate change.

At the company’s annual meeting at the Morton H. Meyerson symphony center in downtown Dallas, Texas, sixty-two percent of shareholders voted for the resolution, against Exxon’s management. This is up from last year’s thirty-eight percent vote.









The resolution, introduced by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, states:

“[The company] should analyze the impacts on Exxon Mobil’s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2-degree [C] target…This reporting should assess the resilience of the company’s full portfolio of reserves and resources through 2040 and beyond, and address the financial risks associated with such a scenario.”

Leading the vote was Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England. He said:

“Trump is acting contrary to Wall Street and the world’s largest investors. Climate change is a material financial risk and shareholders want to know how companies will manage the change to a low carbon economy.”

The vote forces Exxon Mobil to conduct an annual “stress test” to measure how climate change regulation and new technology affect oil assets.

Mason said:

“[The company’s board members] recognized the significance of the agreed international goals on climate change [in their other roles].”

Susan Avery, former president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Exxon Mobil board member, said:

“Clearly climate science is telling us get off fossil fuels as much as possible.”

Former CEO of Xerox and Exxon board member Ursula Burns had previously signed the Obama administration’s climate pledge. Board member and Merck chairman/CEO Kenneth Frazier also favors action addressing climate change.

Chief executive Darren Woods said:

“We believe the risks of climate change are serious and warrant action, thoughtful action. As a company we are taking action in many ways.”

He also stated Exxon was doing enough to address the impact of climate change and regulation on its business, and that the board was against the proposal.

He added:

“The board believes the company has adequately assessed the future impact of policy developments.”

New York comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli said:

“This is an unprecedented victory for investors in the fight to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of Exxon Mobil. The burden is now on Exxon Mobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously.”

While appearing on CNN Thursday morning to discuss President Trump’s plan to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, former Pennsylvania Senator and failed presidential candidate Rick Santorum proved why no one will ever take him seriously.









Santorum began by saying the president should use Twitter to promote his agenda instead of attacking the media, adding:

“If he wants to get on message then he needs to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord or maybe even a halfway measure.”

Former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm, who was also a guest, replied:

“No, no, no! There are 3.3 million people in America that are working in the clean energy industry. If you look at my state, there are almost 90,000 jobs in clean energy right now.”

To that very good factual point, Santorum responded:

“We have a fracking revolution. And it’s driving down the cost of our electricity.”

Yeah, a fracking revolution which is now causing increased seismic activity in places that have never before experienced such things. Not to mention the toxicity of the fluid used in fracking.









Again, Graholm used facts to make her case:

“Solar and wind are cheaper than coal. Right now, China is cancelling 107 of its coal plants because why? Solar and wind are cheaper than coal. Same in India.”

That’s when Santorum reached into his pocket and pulled out his stupid card, declaring:

“It’s not reliable, it’s not consistent.”

To that, Granholm could only exclaim:

“Oh my god!”

Here’s the truth, which Santorum neglects to understand or acknowledge: The sun is expected to last another 5 billion years. Life on earth will be around about another billion. That sounds pretty damn reliable and consistent to me.

In some good news, a push for less discrimination and equality for the LGBTQ has had a win in Oregon. The Governor Kate Brown of Oregon signed a Transgender equality bill and has said the government has no place in “…Dictating personal identity.”

The bill, HB 2673, has been put in place to make it easier for Transgender people who wish to amend their birth certificates and other identity certificates so they state the same gender they identify with.









This is a matter that many non-transgender people might not consider as a difficulty that accompanies being transgender. Imagine feeling you were born in the wrong body and the discrimination that comes with it. Then imagine a situation where you are asked to prove your identity and the only document you can produce does not reflect who you are. It might even add ammunition to the people who may be discriminating against you. This new bill allows transgender people the dignity and ability to attain papers that are aligned with who they are much more easily.









Transgender people are discriminated against in many ways, in the workplace, socially, and they are even murdered at higher rates. This is unacceptable and any bill that pushes for the protection of this community, is a compassionate and worthy one. With this bill and thanks to Gov. Kate Brown, Transgender people can now apply for their amended identification documents in a more affordable and simpler way.

JoDee Winterhof of Human Rights Campaign(HRC) reacted with this statement:

‘By signing this legislation into law, Governor Kate Brown is helping to make Oregon an even more inviting and inclusive place for transgender people to call home. We congratulate Basic Rights Oregon on this important victory and thank Governor Brown for her continued outstanding leadership on LGBTQ equality.’

In a tweet the Governor herself said this:

At a time where the White House is moving to take away protections from the Transgender community, this is welcome, good news.

It is also evidence that progressive policies can be achieved at local levels.

The famous electoral prognosticator Larry Sabato recently shocked a CNN host when he boldly proclaimed that he believed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton would win the presidency with 352 electoral votes. Looking at the math, though 352 may be a stretch, we WILL inaugurate the first woman president on January 20, 2017.

The Road To 270

As I discussed in detail in my Electoral College 101 piece for Liberal America, a presidential candidate must win 270 of the 538 total electoral college votes in order to win the presidency. It is possible for this to happen even when a candidate does not win the popular vote, as we saw in the election of 2000.

As it stands now, with fewer than two weeks to go, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could win all the states that are expected to vote red, including the ones that just “lean” Republican, AND every single swing state, and he still will not win the election. All those states would give him just 245 votes. That’s 25 short of a win.

On the other hand, if Clinton wins every state that is expected to vote blue, as she is expected to do, she will have 293 electoral votes.

The Cook Political Scorecard And FiveThirtyEight

The Cook Political Report, a non-partisan newsletter, published the following scorecard on October 27, 2016:

Or seen visually:

As you can see, the math looks grim for the Donald. If he wins the 179 votes he’s expected to win PLUS the 66 that are the tossup votes, he’s still short.

The Cook report still has Florida as a tossup (swing) state. However, Nate Silver’s current projection for that state — the most coveted of all swing states in any presidential race — has Clinton winning.

The New York Times has a great interactive tool on The Upshot portion of their website as well. The tool assumes certain electoral votes going to each candidate, and you can try different scenarios to see how many paths to victory each candidate has. As the math goes, if you give every blue state shown above to Clinton, she wins. The Upshot puts Clinton’s chances of winning at 92 percent.

Basically, only something monumentally catastrophic will cause her to lose this election.









You Still Have To VOTE

Of course, despite our headline here, everyone still has to vote to make this a reality. If Democrats get complacent, then that map could get a lot redder. That’s what tends to happen in “off-year” elections, since the Republicans are a lot more likely to get out and vote. It’s why we have a House of Representatives that has been gerrymandered to the point that it’s nearly impossible for the Democrats to regain control of it.

In 2012, House Democrats received more votes than Republicans, yet the Republicans retained control. Why? Redistricting. Had more Democrats voted in 2010, we may not be in such a predicament. Districts are redrawn at least once every 10 years, and the party that controls each state’s legislature generally tends to redraw them to their party’s favor. While some (myself included) may argue that districts should be drawn in a much more equitable manner, the fact remains that, currently, the party in power draws the district to their favor.

So go out and vote. Not just this year, but in every election. Every time. Vote in your local elections. Vote in primaries and general elections. Make your voice heard.

And let’s make this map even more blue.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has created quite a pile of sh*t this election season – or, as he calls it, “campaigning.” Naturally, many people are curious about the man and they’re googling for more info about him. What’s interesting, however, is that interest in The Donald varies widely by state.

Here’s the visual. Montana — ouch (sociopath).

More of the best:

1. California

Californians are, naturally, looking for a new place to live.

2. Nevada

Nevada wants to know if he can win.

3. Washington State

Yes, the Trump Voodoo Doll is really a thing.

4. Iowa

Iowans are wondering if Trump is deliberately trying to appeal to these racist jackasses that are supporting him.

The answer is yes.

5. Alabama

*Sigh* My state just thinks Melania is hot. (I’m not googling that shit.)

6. New York

In his home state, they are trying to find ways to get him to quit.

7. Maine

People in Maine want to know about Trump steaks and if they are actually good.

North Carolina is just really concerned as to why Trump is orange.

11. South Carolina

South Carolina is looking for Trump endorsements. Dear South Carolina: they’re all nutjobs.









12. Texas

Texans want to know what will happen if Trump wins.

13. Hawaii

Hawaii is concerned about his ownership of the Miss Teen USA pageant.

14. Illinois

Illinois wants to find Trump merchandise. I hope they are holding some epic bonfires over there. Read my previous article about Amazon reviews of Trump’s clothing.

15. Ohio

Ohio wants to see Donald Trump movies. I guess they really like the horror genre.

16. Michigan

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has created quite a pile of sh*t this election season – or, as he calls it, “campaigning.” Naturally, many people are curious about the man and they’re googling for more info about him. What’s interesting, however, is that interest in The Donald varies widely by state.

Here’s the visual. Montana — ouch (sociopath).

National Center for Health Statistics just released new data showing that last year, U.S. death rates rose for the first time in a decade.

“The crude death rate for all causes was 841.9 per 100,000 population, an increase from 823.6 in 2014.”

According to New York Times, these numbers have been declining for years as a result of improvements in health, disease management and medical technology. That’s why the sudden turn is surprising, and may be a cause of alarm for the near future

“While it is premature to ring an alarm now, if it continues, it could be a signal of distress in the health of the nation.”

The increase in death rates has been driven by more deaths from drug overdoses, suicide and Alzheimer’s disease.

Recent research confirms sharp rises in death rates among less educated whites, who have been hit hard by the prescription drug epidemic.

New York Times reported earlier this year how deaths from drug overdoses have increased in almost every county across the U.S.









Some of the largest concentrations of overdose deaths were in Appalachia and the Southwest, and they were all

“Driven largely by an explosion in addiction to prescription painkillers and heroin.”

However, increases in an entire population are relatively rare.

The data are not broken down by race, and federal researchers have cautioned that it is too early to tell if the increasing death rates among whites has pushed up the national death rate. Final data will be released later on this year.

New York Times quoted Andrew Fenelon, a researcher at the C.D.C. trying to understand the rising death rates,

“We are not accustomed to seeing death rates increase on a national scale […] We’ve seen increases in mortality for some groups, but it is quite rare to see it for the whole population.”

Another aspect is the comparison with other western countries, which are generally experiencing longer life spans in an increasingly healthier population. This new data will drag the U.S. further behind its European peers:

“Many countries in Europe are witnessing declines in mortality, so the gap between the U.S. and other countries is growing.”

Pew Research Center just released a new study that shed light on how America’s economic problem in the metropolitan area have opened the door for political polar opposites Donald Trump (R- NY) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT).

It’s generally agreed-upon that the strength of a country is based on a strong middle class. This is why Pew Research Center’s analysis of the Census Bureau’s data is troubling, since it shows a dramatic decrease of the American middle class in the 21st century.

Pew’s definition of “middle-income” households were those with income that fell between two-thirds and twice the national median household income. The study focused on households in the metropolitan area, and adjusted for household size and for the local cost of living.

Between 2000 and 2014, a staggering 203 out of the 229 metropolitan areas analyzed had a decline in the percentage of their populations that fell in that middle-income range.

Business Insider published a map showing those shifts. The darker the red in each metro area, the more the middle-income group shrank as a percentage of that metro area’s population.

The few blue metro areas represent those that saw an increase in the middle-income share.

Pew’s study noted that the decline in the middle class is associated with an increase in inequality in the US. The map of the dwindling middle class may also indicate a rise in anxiety throughout the American public.

This, in turn, can help explain the surprising rise and popularity of such far end of the spectrum candidacies as the foreign- and Muslim-opposed Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump and Democratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders.









In fact, the decline of the middle class in America’s cities is one of the biggest political and economic problems of the 21st century. Pew addressed the severity of the metropolitan area problem in the report:

“The current and future status of the American middle class continues to be a central issue in the 2016 presidential campaign. Moreover, new economic research suggests that a struggling middle class could be holding back the potential for future economic growth.”

While closing borders for people and trade may seem like a safe solution for some voters in order to strengthen the country, it’s obvious for others that closing the gap between the rich and the poor will help restore the middle class, and thus create a strong foundation to truly make America great again.

What if I told you that a right-wing radio host openly declared that “white power” was the only thing that keeps this country going? You’d probably wonder how he was still on the air. Well, what if I told you that host was a member of one of the most exclusive clubs in this country? Specifically, a black conservative who has bowed down to Donald Trump.









It’s been amply established that the standards to get into this club aren’t all that high. After all, consider some of its members. There’s Mark Burns, the South Carolina pastor who declared Democrats were the enemy during his benediction at the Republican National Convention, and tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton in blackface. And there’s former reality TV star Omarosa, who declared during the campaign that the country would have to bow down to Trump if he won. After Trump’s upset victory, Omarosa became a public engagement adviser to Trump, and used that role to warn a reporter that the White House had dossiers on its critics.

But black conservative pastor Jesse Lee Peterson may have outdone them all on the Wednesday edition of his radio show. During the show’s third hour, he openly declared that whites were the only ones who keep this country going. People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch got a clip.

Roughly seven minutes into the show’s third hour, Peterson and his producer, James Hake, engaged in what started out as a boilerplate case of a right-wing host offering fawning praise to Trump. Peterson said that while he had believed from the start that Trump was going to make America great again, even he was surprised by how “the light that’s within him” would “expose the darkness” in both this country and the world. Not entirely surprising, since Peterson considers Trump to be a shining example of how a real man should act.









He then praised Trump for shoving Montenegrin Prime Minister Dusko Markovic at last weekend’s NATO summit. Most of the world saw this as yet another example of boorish, bullying behavior from Trump. Not Peterson.

“He goes overseas, and as those weaklings try to get in front of him during a photo shoot, he pushed them out of the way. Obama would have stood behind in the back, and Trump went up and just grabbed the guy and pushed him out of the way. He got out in front.”

To Peterson’s mind, Trump was telling the world, “I’m the baddest man in town! A new sheriff is in town!” Hake was also pleased by it, and wanted to get the video.

But then Peterson crossed the line from mere alternative facting to something more sinister.

“White power! White power! I’m loving it. I love good. I love the light, I love it. And it doesn’t matter the color of the person that the light is coming from. I love it. I rejoice when I see men and women stand up with the love of God operating through them, overcoming evil.”

Wait a minute. In one breath, Peterson praises “white power,” then says that the color of your skin doesn’t matter if the light is shining through you?

Peterson then said that for much of Obama’s presidency, he believed that God had “given up on us” as a nation. He and Hake recalled how Hillary “sailed” through a Fox News interview in 2014. Both Peterson and Hake believed at the time that Hillary’s momentum was almost unstoppable. But Peterson claimed that one night while he was praying, God told him, “Be cool, Trump is coming. I will send my son and he will save you.”

Hake then recalled that there were a lot of white millennials, like himself, who were enamored with Trump and were “willing to fight” for him. Peterson agreed, saying that it was “beautiful” to see whites–especially young whites–“finally standing up” by suporting Trump. At that point, he really went off the deep end.

“It’s so refreshing, because if white people give up completely, it’s over for the country. It’s the whites who make things happen. Blacks and Mexicans don’t make things happen.”

Hake allowed that “very few” minorities actually do anything. Peterson agreed, allowing that “one or two” minorities at most actually make an impact. Nonetheless, the message was unmistakable–people of color really don’t do anything worth mentioning.

It turns out that this isn’t the first time Peterson has spewed something along these lines. A week after Trump took office, he dropped by Steve Malzberg’s show and claimed that only a white man like Trump could solve the rampant crime problem in areas like Chicago. Watch here.

Peterson said–with a straight face–that black men can’t “clean up their own neighborhoods” and “put their own families back together.” Only a white man can do it.

Granted, we’ve learned not to expect much from Peterson. This is a man who thinks blacks were better off before the civil rights movement, and also believes businesses should be able to discriminate with impunity. But with this latest screed, Peterson was blowing a dog whistle into a megaphone. If Malzberg, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, or any other white right-winger were to say something like this, they’d be canceled before the next break.

You may recall that earlier in the spring, after I blasted Peterson for his outrageous defense of Bill O’Reilly, Hake invited me to call into Peterson’s show. But I threw that offer back at him after his boss claimed that people who divorce are “selfish” if they remarry while their kids are still living with them. As someone who fled a marriage to an emotionally abusive woman, I considered it insulting on a personal level. It amounted to victim shaming.

As far as Hake was concerned, that made me a coward.

You want to argue behind a screen. I'm not wasting time on a closed minded coward. Call jesse or go away. — James Anton Hake (@JamesAntonHake) May 15, 2017

This is coming from a man whose boss engages in rhetoric that has no place in civilized discourse. Victim shaming, out-and-out racism, the lot. And said boss is only willing to respond in a forum that he controls. That says it all, from where I’m sitting.

Despite vocal opposition from businesses, advisers, and prominent members of his own party, President Donald Trump announced today that he would take America out of the Paris Agreement. The historic climate deal was developed in 2015 and signed by over 190 nations. The U.S. now joins Nicaragua and Syria as the only nations within the United Nations not subject to the agreement.









Trump argued that his decision would “put American workers first.” He suggested that the Paris Agreement would hurt the American economy, especially the fossil fuel industry. `But Roberton Williams, director of academic programs for the nonpartisan environmental and energy analysis group Resources for the Future, said:

“[The jobs losses would be] noticeable, but small enough that you wouldn’t even see it in the numbers. And the reason for that is it’s really, the effect would be much more of a job shift, rather than a job gain or a job loss.”

Williams explained that while some industries would be hurt (like coal mining or oil production), other industries (like the renewable energy sector) would gain new jobs as America came into compliance with the agreement.

Trump’s decision will only deepen the growing rift between the U.S. and the rest of the world. Exiting the deal shows that the U.S. is unwilling to follow through on its promises, and will hurt America’s reputation on the world stage.

Just prior to Trump’s official announcement that he would take the U.S. out of the agreement, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said:

“Ignoring reality and leaving the Paris agreement could go down as one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our nation’s history, isolating the U.S. further after Trump’s shockingly bad European trip.”

The U.S. contributes more greenhouse gas emissions than any other nation except China. Climate scientists have warned that even with the passage of the Paris Agreement, average global temperatures are expected to rise by at least 2 degrees Celsius (about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Warming greater than that would lead to catastrophic flooding, drought, extinctions, refugee crises, and war.









Now that the U.S. is out of the deal and on track to completely eliminate its environmental protections, the painful effects of climate change will likely accelerate.

Some observers are more sanguine. They cite recent economic trends – namely, the falling cost of natural gas and renewables against the high cost of fossil fuels – as reason for optimism. In a recent interview with NBC, J. Timmons Roberts, an environmental studies professor at Brown University, said that the U.S. might meet its emissions reduction targets even in the absence of a binding agreement.

“I actually think we might meet our target. The technology is making the choices easier for people more quickly than expected.”

California and some other states have pledged to increase their environmental regulations in response to Trump removing the U.S. from the agreement.

In his comments, Trump did leave open the possibility of renegotiating the deal along lines that he finds more amenable. But it remains unclear what such a renegotiated deal would look like, or if such a deal is even possible.

Trump will have to wait until the end of 2019 to completely exit the deal. But he could accelerate the exit process by canceling the domestic climate treaty linked to the Paris Agreement.

By ending environmental protections in the U.S. and canceling America’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, Trump poses a true danger not only to the country, but to the world.

Ohio Bill Forces Citizens To Prop Up Dirty Coal Power Plants (VIDEO) Even as advances in renewable energy continue to make it cheaper and more competitive, and coal continues its long 30-year decline, Ohio lawmakers are proposing legislation that would subsidize two coal-fired power plants – forever.

Trump Budget Will Ruin The Clean Energy Industry (VIDEO) President Donald Trump’s 2018 budget is pretty terrible.

No Matter How You Slice It American Cops Are Killing Too Many American Citizens (VIDEO) In his inaugural address, President Donald Trump pledged to stop the “American carnage” he believed was wracking the country.

"You know the times they are a-changing when Exxon Mobil starts sticking up for the environment.

For nearly forty years, Exxon Mobil engaged in an expensive disinformation campaign to bury evidence of climate change the company had a role in contributing to through its activity.









Former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson is now our nation’s sixty-ninth Secretary of State at a time we have a blatant climate denier in the White House. Clearly in the struggle between transnational fossil fuel corporations and the Earth, the former appears the victor. Right?

Maybe not.

In a surprising turn of events Wednesday, Exxon Mobil shareholders cast a historic vote to compel the fossil fuel monolith to be more forthcoming about climate change’s impact on its business. This comes as President Donald Trump is reportedly prepared to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, the agreement nearly 200 countries signed to address global climate change.

At the company’s annual meeting at the Morton H. Meyerson symphony center in downtown Dallas, Texas, sixty-two percent of shareholders voted for the resolution, against Exxon’s management. This is up from last year’s thirty-eight percent vote.









The resolution, introduced by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, states:

“[The company] should analyze the impacts on Exxon Mobil’s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2-degree [C] target…This reporting should assess the resilience of the company’s full portfolio of reserves and resources through 2040 and beyond, and address the financial risks associated with such a scenario.”

Leading the vote was Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England. He said:

“Trump is acting contrary to Wall Street and the world’s largest investors. Climate change is a material financial risk and shareholders want to know how companies will manage the change to a low carbon economy.”

The vote forces Exxon Mobil to conduct an annual “stress test” to measure how climate change regulation and new technology affect oil assets.

Mason said:

“[The company’s board members] recognized the significance of the agreed international goals on climate change [in their other roles].”

Susan Avery, former president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Exxon Mobil board member, said:

“Clearly climate science is telling us get off fossil fuels as much as possible.”

Former CEO of Xerox and Exxon board member Ursula Burns had previously signed the Obama administration’s climate pledge. Board member and Merck chairman/CEO Kenneth Frazier also favors action addressing climate change.

Chief executive Darren Woods said:

“We believe the risks of climate change are serious and warrant action, thoughtful action. As a company we are taking action in many ways.”

He also stated Exxon was doing enough to address the impact of climate change and regulation on its business, and that the board was against the proposal.

He added:

“The board believes the company has adequately assessed the future impact of policy developments.”

New York comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli said:

“This is an unprecedented victory for investors in the fight to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of Exxon Mobil. The burden is now on Exxon Mobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously.”

Trump Expected To Withdraw From Paris Climate Accord And Further Imperil American Communities (VIDEO) After informing G7 leaders he will make a “final decision on the Paris accord next week,” President Donald Trump took exactly one day to conclude cutting domestic greenhouse gas emissions 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 is simply not worth it. Denial is not a river in Egypt, but if it were, it would be rising […]

Trump To G7 Leaders About Paris Climate Treaty: ‘I’ll Think About It’ (VIDEO) Just once we would like to see President Donald Trump get something right, even if by accident.

Fear Of Dubious Email Scared Jim Comey Into Blowing The Election For Hillary Clinton (VIDEO) Russia is like a rotten board we see on the side of our house: the deeper we excavate, the more widespread we discover the rot to be.

House GOP Bill GUTS Consumer Financial Protections (VIDEO) It should come as no surprise that when Republicans tell us they are protecting “freedoms,” they don’t mean ours.” When they claim to be holding Wall Street “accountable,” they’re concerned only with the “account” part. The new “Financial CHOICE Act” Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) introduced last month shouldn’t fool us either. Being sold as financial reform […]

New York Continues Progressive Streak By Advancing Legislation To Improve Voting Could New York be competing with California for the title of “most progressive state?” Could New York Governor Andrew M.

Cuomo […]

The FCC Votes To Dismantle Net Neutrality Rules, Give Telcoms Control Of Internet (VIDEO) Well, it happened… The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted by two-to-one Thursday to begin unraveling a key 2015 decision by former President Barack Obama protecting consumers’ internet content in favor of relaxing regulations on internet service providers.

This Could Be The Week We Learn The Fate Of The Free And Open Internet (VIDEO) You may have heard lately about a little thing called “net neutrality.” It isn’t particularly sexy. It doesn’t involve Trump or his extended family. It isn’t part of the conversation regarding the president’s submission of classified intelligence to the Russian government. It isn’t one of the myriad reasons Trump is unfit to hold the nation’s […]

Republicans Love Our Veterans–Except When It Comes To Paying For Their Service (VIDEO) President Donald Trump keeps telling us how much he loves the military. Last January in Des Moines, Iowa, he held a “fundraiser” for veterans for which he supposedly raised $6 million. It took him nearly four months to actually get around to donating $1 million of it — and then only after a Washington Post reporter asked what […]

Trump’s ‘Voter Fraud’ Commission Is Putting The Fox In Charge Of The Hen House (VIDEO) President Donald Trump has formed a commission. It’s not looking into shenanigans Russia is alleged to have engaged in during the election. It isn’t going to probe institutional racism in policing those responsible for extra-judicial killings of unarmed Blacks. It isn’t concerned with the impact of climate change. It isn’t planning on addressing the skyrocketing […]

Jared Kushner’s Sister Promises Visas To Chinese Businesses (VIDEO) President Trump’s incessant denial of any conflicts of interest are beginning to reach farcical levels.

Activism Works: Federal Budget Maintains Funding For Essential Services–At Least For Now (VIDEO) There is much cause for concern these days.

Agriculture Sec.

"2002 SHARES Facebook Twitter Reddit Stumbleupon Pinterest

Though he hasn’t yet been able to admit that he screwed up and typed the wrong thing when he sent out his midnight “covfefe” tweet, the vast majority of the world realizes that President Trump is a complete moron and isn’t capable of saying he made a mistake.









But now we have Trump supporters on Reddit claiming that “covfefe” is actually a secret anti-terror message Trump was sending to those in the know.

You may now shake your head and laugh uncontrollably.

Yes, Trump fans at Reddit’s /r/The_Donald site have been suggesting exactly what their savior was trying to convey, and they understand perfectly. Here’s some of the postings:

“Cov fe’fe means “I’ll stand up” translated from Arabic! The President God Emperor is giving us hope in troubled times!”

“Despite the negative media, I will stand up. Cov fe’fe means ‘I will stand up’ in Arabic. Trump never makes mistakes, you guys.”

“COVFEFE IS A MESSAGE IN ARABIC!”

Just to be perfectly clear, there is no word in Arabic that is even remotely similar to “covfefe,” not even if you break it up and spell it “cov fe’fe.” Apparently some of the simpletons who back the Donald got that idea from Google Translate.









But that didn’t deter the Trump faithful, who also had this to say about Trump’s inane Twitter babbling:

“26D chess!. He got everyone to cover the ‘covfefe scandal’ and once it is realized by the normies that he did actually mean something, they’ll be forced to cover that too! F*cking genius Trump!”

“So he wanted the media and the leftist retards to think he screwed up. He let them go on and on and on, while we just had a blast with it. That Magnificent Mad Man.”

Or perhaps you prefer this bit of incomprehension from another Trump acolyte: Trump is using Arabic to convert Muslims to his global cause to make America great again:

“He’s redpilling them in their own language!”

Personally, I prefer this explanation: Trump was sleepy, decided to send out a tweet, and then the drugs he takes kicked in and he drifted off. Because the thought that a man who can barely speak English learned Arabic (or learned ANYTHING) is simply beyond all belief.

So, Trumpkins, put that in your pipe and covfefe it.

While appearing on CNN Thursday morning to discuss President Trump’s plan to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, former Pennsylvania Senator and failed presidential candidate Rick Santorum proved why no one will ever take him seriously.









Santorum began by saying the president should use Twitter to promote his agenda instead of attacking the media, adding:

“If he wants to get on message then he needs to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord or maybe even a halfway measure.”

Former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm, who was also a guest, replied:

“No, no, no! There are 3.3 million people in America that are working in the clean energy industry. If you look at my state, there are almost 90,000 jobs in clean energy right now.”

To that very good factual point, Santorum responded:

“We have a fracking revolution. And it’s driving down the cost of our electricity.”

Yeah, a fracking revolution which is now causing increased seismic activity in places that have never before experienced such things. Not to mention the toxicity of the fluid used in fracking.









Again, Graholm used facts to make her case:

“Solar and wind are cheaper than coal. Right now, China is cancelling 107 of its coal plants because why? Solar and wind are cheaper than coal. Same in India.”

That’s when Santorum reached into his pocket and pulled out his stupid card, declaring:

“It’s not reliable, it’s not consistent.”

To that, Granholm could only exclaim:

“Oh my god!”

Here’s the truth, which Santorum neglects to understand or acknowledge: The sun is expected to last another 5 billion years. Life on earth will be around about another billion. That sounds pretty damn reliable and consistent to me.

"There are concerns that President Donald Trump is about to pull funding from Tibetans in exile for 2018. The worrying reports come at the same time that talks of a possible meeting between the Dalai Lama and Trump are also happening.









Sonam Dagpo, the Secretary for international relations has said:

“I am awaiting the official document as of now. There is a 24-hour time gap between here and Washington. Once it comes, then we will go through it. I have read reports but can’t react over that.”









The Shanghaiist also reported that the cuts would end a decade long policy to help Tibetans in exile – amounting to cutting millions of dollars. People have speculated that this could be because Trump is trying to win China’s favour. Lobsang Wangyal, a Tibetan exile suggested to the Times of India that Trump may think the move will ‘thaw’ relations with China. However about the proposed cuts he also said:

“The move is contrary to American ideals of freedom, equality, and justice. Time will tell if Trump’s policy is really in line with his ‘Make America Great Again’

While it is just a proposal at the moment, no one would be surprised if this administration really did cut Tibet’s funding to zero. They have after all voted to kick millions off healthcare by repealing Obamacare, as well as dropping meals for the elderly and poor school children. Compassion is something that the Dalai Lama and Trump clearly do not have in common.

The amazing thing about the Dalai Lama is that he is always happy and seemingly worry-free – not even the election of the inexperienced Donald Trump, to the most powerful role in the world, seemed to bother him in the slightest – not even the Pope is that holy.

Perhaps the Dalai Lama says it best with this Tweet:

Money and power attract friends. But it’s not you they’re friends with — just your money and power. Only affection brings genuine friends. — Dalai Lama (@DalaiLama) May 12, 2017

Nigel Farage is a person of interest into the FBI’s investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia.

Founder of the far-right United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and chief engineer of the disastrous Brexit vote, he was named earlier today. According to the Guardian:

“Sources with knowledge of the investigation said the former Ukip leader had raised the interest of FBI investigators because of his relationships with individuals connected to both the Trump campaign and Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder whom Farage visited in March.”

Farage has not as of yet been accused of any wrongdoing. The FBI label ‘person of interest’ only denotes that a given person might have information they are seeking. But with a UK election just days away, bitter divisions over Brexit look set to polarize even further.









Because Farage seems to be the focus of a lot of unwanted attention. Sources who spoke to the Guardian claimed that his connection to Trump first drew suspicion:

“One of the things the intelligence investigators have been looking at is points of contact and persons involved,” one source said. “If you triangulate Russia, WikiLeaks, Assange, and Trump associate the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage. He’s right in the middle of these relationships. He turns up over and over again. There’s a lot of attention being paid to him.”

The source also mentioned Farage’s links with Roger Stone, Trump’s long-time political adviser who has admitted being in contact with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker whom U.S. intelligence agencies believe to be a Kremlin agent.

Brexit Bro’s

Trump jumped into the Brexit debate back in March when he said:

“I think they (Britain) may leave the EU, yes, they’re having a lot of problems.”

Having correctly identified one of the possible outcomes of the referendum, he preceded to set out his reasoning in a typically robust way. He commented on the vote, insisted that he did not want to comment on the vote, then immediately commented on it again, saying:

“I think they may leave based on – I’m there a lot, I have a lot of investments in the UK and I will tell you that I think they may leave based on everything I’m hearing.”

Shortly after the results of the referendum came in Trump treated it as something of a personal victory.

They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2016

Time passed. Nobody called him that.

The Lies That Bind

His links to Farage are convoluted, to say the least.

Back in August 2016, Farage attended a Trump rally in Mississippi where he was introduced by Trump as:

“The man behind Brexit, and the man who led – brilliantly – the United Kingdom Independence Party, and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles.”

Farage’s message to the gathered faithful mirrored Trump’s own take on the political world; right-wing ambition fueled by populist anti-establishment rhetoric:

“We reached those people who’ve been let down by modern global corporatism. We reached those people who have never voted in their lives, but believed that by going out and voting for Brexit, they could take back control of their country, take back control of their borders, and get back their pride and self-respect.”

In October he was in St Louis, Missouri helping Trump prepare for a televised debate and was quick to defend Trump’s pussy grabbing comments. He refused to draw a distinction between male bravado and casual discussion of sexual assault opining that:

“Look, this is alpha male boasting. It’s the kind of thing, if we are being honest, that men do. They sit around and have a drink and they talk like this.”

It was Farage — and not British Prime Minster Theresa May — who was the first British politician to meet Donald Trump following his election victory. Which is hardly surprising considering how much the pair have in common. They both hold Russian President Vladimir Putin in the highest regard.

Indeed, in a 2014 interview Farage admitted that Putin was the man he admired most in the world.

Suspicious Minds

Despite having told assembled journalists he was only a “tourist” as he entered Trump Tower in November, he paid visits on at least two other occasions raising speculation that he had been given a new role advising on UK/US trade deals. Shortly after, Trump made it known that he would like to keep Farage close to his bosom.

Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016

The British government declined since it was, as The Guardian pointed out:

“Unprecedented for an incoming US president to ask a world leader to appoint an opposing party leader as ambassador, and the statement puts (Prime Minister) May in a difficult position.”

By January Farage had secured a lucrative deal with Fox News as a political commentator and was boasting that he was:

“Treated like a ‘rock star’ in the U.S.,” and that there was a “Huge temptation to up sticks and move to America.”









Conspiracy Theory

All of which sounds like one hell of a reward for simply agreeing with Trump on a number of key — yet ill-defined — policy matters. Still, at least it fits well within an easily observed pattern of behavior.

During the same week one-time French presidential hopeful and now soundly defeated fascist Marine Le Penn also paid a low-key, off the record visit to Trump Tower.

Far right French candidate Marine LePen is having coffee in Trump Tower right now. She wouldn’t say what she was doing there. h/t @srl pic.twitter.com/9YSC3e6Dl1 — Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) January 12, 2017

Le Penn declined to say whether she was there to see President-elect Donald Trump or not. The Trump team however, well aware of Le Penn’s financial dependence on Russian loans were quick to stamp out any rumors. They insisted that there would be:

“No meetings.”

Sean Spicer also jumped into the fray, re-tweeting a post by CNN’s Noah Gray.

.@seanspicer tells me Marine le Pen is NOT meeting w/ PEOTUS or anyone else from transition team. Adds “Trump Tower is open to the Public” — Noah Gray (@NoahGrayCNN) January 12, 2017

Still, unconfirmed reports suggested that the man to Ms. Le Pen’s right in the photo was Guido “George” Lombardi.

Lombardi has links to a number of right-wing European parties. He also works as an adviser for Mr. Trump. Not that Le Penn was the only far right Putin-linked fascist that team Trump courted.

As Liberal America reported last January:

“Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of Austria’s far-right FPÖ a party founded by former SS officers ( yes, actual honest to goodness, ethnic-cleansing, skulls-on-their-hats Nazis,) were treated as a welcome addition to Trump’s inner circle.”

What Lies Beneath

Of course, We have the denials.

Farage’s spokesman denied any contact with Russian officials, and described the Guardian’s questions about his activities as:

“Verging on the hysterical. Nigel has never been to Russia, let alone worked with their authorities.”

However, according to the Guardian:

“He did not respond to questions about whether Farage was aware of the FBI inquiry; had hired a lawyer in connection to the matter; or when Farage first met Trump.”

Furthermore:

“The spokesman also declined to comment on whether Farage had received compensation from the Russian state-backed media group RT for his media appearances. RT, which has featured Farage about three times over the last 18 months, also declined to comment, citing confidentiality.”

As has been noted, Russian president Vladimir Putin covets a weak and divided Europe. He has scored some victories over the past few years. Trump won the election. Unwitting dupe or active thrall he’s the guy sitting in the White House. The creation of a transatlantic alliance intent on turning the clock back to the 1930’s is real.

The alliance dreams of a world where people are hypnotized by the illusory magnificence of their own nationality. Of a world of Brexit where people sacrifice hard-won labor rights in exchange for watery promises of national purity. It is a world of Muslim bans, a place where people willingly give up rights in return for handfuls of placebos.

But mostly, it is a world of organized chaos, a world of nation-states and war. A world where the supra-national organizations capable of dealing with existential threats like climate change are dismantled and in their place, there is only the nation-state.

Warring, fractious, and above all, fascist.

Watch Farage gush over Trump’s magnificence.

It was a refrain Donald Trump used repeatedly during the 2016 campaign: If elected, he would “drain the swamp” and eliminate the old order in Washington where lobbyists and politicians scratch each others backs in exchange for money and favors.









But now, as president, it appears Trump has merely restocked the metaphorical swamp, and the new creatures that inhabit it also happen to be members of his administration.

Late Wednesday, President Trump granted ethics waivers to 17 of his top White House aides, including chief strategist Steve Bannon, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, along with four former lobbyists who are now members of the Trump team.

The pace of the ethics waivers is unprecedented. The 17 senior White House appointees have been granted ethics waivers in a mere four months time. In contrast, President Obama granted that same number of waivers to his top staff over the course of his eight years in office.

White House lawyers defended the waivers by saying they were justified because the administration’s “need for the covered employee’s services outweighs the concern” that the employees might put their own financial interests ahead of the interests of the country.









In the case of Conway, her waiver allows her to meet and communicate with former clients of her consulting firm, though the White House didn’t bother to explain how that was more important than Conway being able to make a buck while also receiving a salary paid for by taxpayers.

Bannon’s waiver will allow him to communicate with news organizations. Seeing as how Bannon is the former CEO of Breitbart News, this means Bannon can now coordinate strategy with right-wing websites and news networks as the administration continues their dissemination of propaganda to the masses.

White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the waivers keep “the president’s commitment to the American people to be transparent.” She added:

“The White House Counsel’s Office worked closely with all White House officials to avoid conflicts arising from their former places of employment or investment holdings. To the furthest extent possible, counsel worked with each staffer to recuse from conflicting conduct rather than being granted waivers, which has led to the limited number of waivers being issued.”

Drain the swamp? Trump is filling it to overflowing.

"A celebrity name has been put forward as a Democratic candidate for the Governor of Ohio. He has been a talk show host, more famous for entertainment, and yet far more politically experienced than the current president, Donald Trump.

Give up?









It is none other than Jerry Springer.

Yes, as in “Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!” That one.

Ted Strickland, former Governor of Ohio, told Business Insider that he had been speaking with Jerry Springer about the possibility. Strickland, who also ran for the senate last year, said he had:

“…Been doing whatever I could to encourage any of those who are talking about running … and I think it’s important that we win and that we have the strongest possible candidate.”

Expanding on why Springer would be a good choice, Strickland then added that Springer:

“…Certainly would start out with wide name.”

The world was stunned when reality TV star Trump, a man with no military or political experience, managed to pull off the fluke of the millennium by winning the presidency last year.









However, Jerry Springer does have actual political experience dating back to the 1970s. He has been the Mayor of Cincinnati, but he has also unsuccessfully attempted to be the Democratic nominee for the Governor of Ohio in 1982. He has also talked of running again in the early 2000s and again just a few years ago.

Springer has been a lawyer, a musician, and played an active role in his hometown of Cincinnati, even helping to save the Cincinnati Union Terminal. He is most famous for his sensational and over the top television show, The Jerry Springer Show. This program was hugely successful and made him a household name. It was the show that brought other people’s domestic disputes into America’s living rooms.

It seems he is still popular enough that Democrats such as Strickland are keen to use his well known status to ensure a win as Governor.

While all of this speculation goes on, Springer himself has thrown water on the idea as he recently tweeted this:

Article about me running for Ohio Gov? If I throw my hat in the ring, I'll let folks know. Right now, I don't even have a hat! — Jerry Springer (@jerryspringer) May 30, 2017

I guess we will have to wait and see.

Apparently all of our concern about members of the Trump campaign and administration are for nothing, according to conservative commentator Michael Reagan, who demonstrated his complete lack of comprehension on CNN Wednesday evening.









During an appearance on CNN Tonight, Reagan made reference to an unsubstantiated claim that the late Ted Kennedy used GOP Senator John Tunney to serve as an intermediary to the Soviet Union for the purpose of defeating President Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination in 1979.

Taken aback, host Don Lemon asked Reagan:

“What are you saying, in the interest of time? What’s the bottom line here? The bottom line is, this is not the first time Russia has tried or been involved in an election….This is not new stuff.”

In reply, Reagan asserted that none of us can possibly know what senior White House adviser Jared Kushner discussed with the Russian ambassador, and he then added this bizarre bit of deeply flawed logic:

“But guess what? Collusion is not breaking the law. Just like Kennedy — he didn’t break the law. It was a political move that he made, just like Jimmy Carter. It was political. It wasn’t breaking the law.”

Lemon:

“Collusion is not breaking the law?”









Pretending to be a lawyer, Reagan asked:

“What law did they break?”

That led the CNN host to say:

“Isn’t that treasonous to do that? I’m not an attorney, but it seems like that’s the whole reason for this investigation by the intelligence community.”

Reagan again repeated:

“Nobody can name the law.”

As for what law Kushner may have broken, Senator Al Franken, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was recently asked by Charlie Rose if what Kushner did was illegal. Franken replied

“I think it is. I mean, you’re supposed to — in getting his security clearance, you’re supposed to list those, and then there’s this peculiar one where he is trying to set up a thing within the Russian communications system so that our own intelligence couldn’t be part of it, which is very unusual. We’re going to be looking at this. You know, this might be — come out to,when, you know, what did the president know and when did his son-in-law tell him?”

President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget makes dramatic cuts to what little remains of the social safety net. If the budget is approved, many will suffer. But Native Americans will be among those hit hardest by the budget’s extreme austerity.









To really understand the abject cruelty of this budget, you have to understand that tribal communities are already living on the edge. Thanks to the systematic repression of native culture, Native American languages are all but extinct. Native youth are almost twice as likely as average American youth to commit suicide. And one in four Native Americans is living in poverty.

The Trump budget does nothing to improve these metrics. Some two million Native Americans receive health care and other services from the Bureau of Indian affairs, an agency within the Interior Department. But Trump’s budget proposal slashes Interior Department funding by 12 percent. That translates to cuts of:

• $64 million for Native American education

• $21 million for reservation law enforcement and safety

• $27 million for natural resources management programs run by tribes

• $23 million from human services

Money for law enforcement is especially important to ensure local safety. The Oglala Sioux tribe’s police budget, for instance, currently supports just 44 officers who are charged with covering a reservation that sprawls 3,468 square miles. That’s an area slightly less than the size of three Rhode Islands.









Tribal education would suffer under the White House budget. One of the deepest cuts to Native American budgets would be the elimination of $1.2 billion in grants for after-school and summer programs. Robert Brave Heart Sr., the executive vice president of Red Cloud Indian School on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, said the Trump administration’s plan would hurt his students. Other cuts to service programs like Americorps would make it more difficult for Indian schools to afford teachers and even bus drivers.

Native American communities would also be hurt by cuts to climate change programs. Trump has called climate change a hoax and installed avowed climate deniers to head many government agencies. But Native tribes, especially those in the Pacific Northwest, consider climate resiliency programs important. Carina Miller, a councilwoman with Oregon’s Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, explained:

“The reality is, is that’s how we lived. The indigenous way of thinking is you’re stewards of the land.”

Mason Big Crow, treasurer of the Oglala Sioux tribe, said his tribe stands to lose at least half of the money it currently receives from federal funds. According to Mel Sheldon, a councilman with the Tulalip Tribes in Washington state:

“This is the single largest attack on Indian Country that we’ve experienced in recent history. There is no doubt that the president has made a statement toward Indian County. It is not a good statement.”

Even the casual student of U.S. history knows that Native Americans have been cheated out of their land, lied to, and brutally massacred throughout much of American history. The Trump budget, if approved, will only perpetuate this mistreatment.

In some good news, a push for less discrimination and equality for the LGBTQ has had a win in Oregon. The Governor Kate Brown of Oregon signed a Transgender equality bill and has said the government has no place in “…Dictating personal identity.”

The bill, HB 2673, has been put in place to make it easier for Transgender people who wish to amend their birth certificates and other identity certificates so they state the same gender they identify with.









This is a matter that many non-transgender people might not consider as a difficulty that accompanies being transgender. Imagine feeling you were born in the wrong body and the discrimination that comes with it. Then imagine a situation where you are asked to prove your identity and the only document you can produce does not reflect who you are. It might even add ammunition to the people who may be discriminating against you. This new bill allows transgender people the dignity and ability to attain papers that are aligned with who they are much more easily.









Transgender people are discriminated against in many ways, in the workplace, socially, and they are even murdered at higher rates. This is unacceptable and any bill that pushes for the protection of this community, is a compassionate and worthy one. With this bill and thanks to Gov. Kate Brown, Transgender people can now apply for their amended identification documents in a more affordable and simpler way.

JoDee Winterhof of Human Rights Campaign(HRC) reacted with this statement:

‘By signing this legislation into law, Governor Kate Brown is helping to make Oregon an even more inviting and inclusive place for transgender people to call home. We congratulate Basic Rights Oregon on this important victory and thank Governor Brown for her continued outstanding leadership on LGBTQ equality.’

In a tweet the Governor herself said this:

At a time where the White House is moving to take away protections from the Transgender community, this is welcome, good news.

It is also evidence that progressive policies can be achieved at local levels.

"The 2014 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition hit the stands Tuesday morning and it, as usual, has the world abuzz — but not for the usual reasons. One of the featured models is none other than controversial icon Barbie. Yes, the doll.

From CNN:

In honor of the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit edition, the magazine has teamed up with Barbie to feature this image in its annual magazine, which hit stands Tuesday. Though both brands have been widely criticized for their depiction of women,?Mattel says?the move is an effort to celebrate entrepreneurs such as Tyra Banks and Heidi Klum who, like Barbie, “launched their careers in a swimsuit.” Look back at some of Barbie’s professions through the years.

















Mattel was proactive in defending its stance. The hashtag campaign of #unapologetic — an internal mission phrase inside the company — is being used on social media and on a Times Square billboard. From a statement:

?As a legend herself, and under constant criticism about her body and how she looks, posing in ?the issue? gives Barbie and her fellow legends an opportunity to own who they are, celebrate what they have done and be #unapologetic.”

Let’s not be too hasty with our concern that Sports Illustrated is embracing the unattainable beauty and perfection of Barbie. Mattel bought its way into the celebrated and controversial Swimsuit Edition.

Mattel paid for the opportunity to integrate Barbie into the commemoration of the anniversary; Mattel and Sports Illustrated declined to be more specific. (CNN)









How do we feel about the hype surrounding the focus on Barbie’s career beginning — the swimsuit model? After all, she’s had a distinguished career as an intellectual?as well. She’s been a dentist, a doctor, a pilot, a homemaker, etc…Shouldn’t we be focusing on those accomplishments? Or no? I’m on the fence on this issue. Yeah…and yeah.

The iconic doll appears in an updated version of her original zebra-striped swimsuit. Whew. I admit that I’m relieved Barbie isn’t wearing a thong. Or…is there a Barbie out there who is?"

"A hot topic circulating the web these days is the acceptance of tattoos in the workplace. Certain professions, mostly those which embody personal expression, have moved into a complete acceptance of tattoos.

However, more traditional business such as law and government tend to stand with their older values and views, making it difficult to acquire a position with large scale, noticeable body art. These different outlooks seem to stem from a demographic separation between the Baby Boomer Generations and the Generation X era.

There seems to be two direct points of view for this controversy currently floating about.?The first group is the?younger generation that has grown up with more focus on personal expression.?The second group is the older generation that has a more conservative background. The younger generations currently seeking employment argue that their tattoos are a personal expression of art and that they do not represent their work ethic or abilities. A 30-something, tattooed, anonymous professional stated during an interview:

I don’t think that people should be judged on their appearance. If they are qualified for the job then that should be the deciding factor.

The ever growing assembly of people who are in support of work place tattoos find it unjust and discriminatory to be judged based off tattoos they choose to have. There is currently no federal regulation toward this type of discrimination.

Those born during the Baby Boomer generation, alongside those working in more conservative roles, find tattoos in the workplace to be inappropriate and unprofessional. Even for those working in these positions, with unbiased views on the issue, often find themselves constrained when hiring due to company policy that has not been reworked in decades. These regulations and thoughts on tattoos also influence the possibility of moving up in careers as well. A survey conducted by CareerBuilder shows that those with tattoos are 31 percent less likely to receive a promotion in a company.?From a customer service standpoint these companies are required to appeal to all ages and types of people, leaving them no choice but to keep their employees in a more conservative visual standpoint.

As time goes by and our younger generations grow into the larger, managerial positions; the stigmas associated with tattoos will begin to fade. Overtime we will see more and more companies opening their positions to those with visible body art, but for now HR departments suggest covering up tattoos and removing piercings when interviewing for a position.

A survey conducted by CareerBuilder shows that those with tattoos are 31 percent less likely to receive a promotion in a company.?From a customer service standpoint these companies are required to appeal to all ages and types of people, leaving them no choice but to keep their employees in a more conservative visual standpoint.

As time goes by and our younger generations grow into the larger, managerial positions; the stigmas associated with tattoos will begin to fade. Overtime we will see more and more companies opening their positions to those with visible body art, but for now HR departments suggest covering up tattoos and removing piercings when interviewing for a position.

Earlier today, we told you that Curt Schilling is catching well-deserved flak for passing on a particularly hateful meme attacking transgender people. Well, late Wednesday night, his bosses at ESPN responded in the most meaningful way possible–they axed him from his post as a baseball analyst.

For those who missed it, Schilling is under fire for posting this to his Facebook page:

In the face of a firestorm of criticism, Schilling tried–and failed–to defend himself in an interview with WEEI in Boston on Wednesday afternoon. He claimed he only replied to the post, but didn’t actually post it. This continued a line he kept up after Outsports first discovered the original post.

@Isaac_Farmer don't care and you are the opposite of right. But keep trying to be offended by anything someone can make up — Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) April 19, 2016

Au contraire, Curt. Au contraire. Not only did you share this, but you also posted a comment:

After a torrent of demands for him to be axed, the Worldwide Leader in Sports issued a terse two-sentence statement that it has always considered itself “an inclusive company.” It added that it had informed Schilling that “his conduct was unacceptable,” and as a result, his services were no longer needed.

ESPN really had no choice here. The network is one of the most LGBT-friendly entities in the sporting world. Two of its top reporters, LZ Granderson and Kate Fagan, are openly gay. Additionally, a baseball editor at ESPN, Christina Kahrl, is a trans woman.

Deadspin’s Kevin Draper notes that this isn’t the first time that Schilling has gone several miles over the line. Last summer, he got in hot water for likening Muslims to Nazis, which led the network to yank him off its coverage of the Little League World Series. Shortly afterward, after ESPN got wind of another Islamophobic email he sent to a blogger, it yanked him off the air for the rest of the year. Earlier this year, he suggested that Hillary Clinton should have been “buried under a jail somewhere.”









But this latest screed from Schilling appeared to be the last straw. Attacking transgender people is bad enough, but when you actually work with them on a regular basis? That, more than anything, is why Schilling got axed.

End Times Rabbi Says God Hacked Election To Punish Obama (VIDEOS, AUDIO) For some time, the religious right has been among the loudest voices warning us against claiming that Russia hacked the election for Donald Trump.

An Unexpected Group Is Pushing For Impeachment–And They May Win (VIDEO) Even in the face of mounting concerns that Donald Trump’s actions have strayed into impeachable offenses, most federal lawmakers have been wary about calling for the House to impeach him.

BREAKING: NSA Ramps Up Search For Evidence Of Trump-Russia Ties (TWEETS) Donald Trump would like you to believe that the whole fuss over Russian interference in the presidential election is fake news.

Jared Kushner Being Pressured To Take A Vacation–This Could Be His O’Reilly Moment (TWEETS) Publicly, the White House reverted to form with its initial response to reports that Donald Trump’s closest confidant and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, asked Russian diplomats to create a secret channel for communications between Moscow and the Trump transition team.

MN State Rep Ducks Question About Tax Haven Bill Because Jesus (VIDEO/TWEETS) Like most left-leaning evangelical Christians, I believe that Christians in public office should be setting the standard, not trying to do an end run around it. Sadly, a state representative in Minnesota is the latest to think that her faith gives her license to avoid being accountable for her votes. Abigail Whelan represents District 35A […]

Some Repubs Are Cheering Greg Gianforte For Attacking A Reporter (VIDEO/TWEETS) For much of this week, the starkest evidence of how the Republican Party has been poisoned by Donald Trump’s hostile takeover was the deafening silence regarding House Appropriations Committee chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen’s deliberate targeting of an activist in his district. Well, the last 24 hours have provided an even starker example. In case you missed […]

RWNJ Pastor Warns Us That God Won’t Allow ‘Sabotage’ Of Trump (VIDEO) By any standard, Donald Trump’s presidency is tanking. As of Tuesday night, FiveThirtyEight pegs his average approval rating at 39.1 percent. Even at this stage, when a president with approval ratings that low, it’s time to call a code. Moreover, the furor over the firing of James Comey and the questions about his campaign’s links to […]

The Deafening GOP Silence On Appropriations Chairman’s Bullying Of A Constituent (VIDEO) At first glance, the most telling anecdote of the Republican mentality in recent weeks came when Lindsey Graham–normally one of the more reasonable Republicans in Washington–suggested it was time to take another look at Hillary Clinton’s emails.

RWNJ Pastor Wants Martial Law Declared If People DARE To Impeach Trump (VIDEO) Among the religious right leaders who are still bowing to Donald Trump, Rick Joyner is in a class by himself. He was one of the first prominent fundies to warn against opposing Trump.

Pro-Trump Thugs Want Dem Congressman Lynched For Saying The I-Word (VIDEOS/AUDIO) To hear the most diehard supporters of Donald Trump talk, you would think that there was an 11th commandment added to the Bible–“Thou shalt not speak ill of Donald Trump.” After all, depending on the source, fundie supporters of Trump believe you’re under the influence of witchcraft and demons, and are putting yourself at risk […]

Roger Ailes’ Son Threatens Women Who ‘Betrayed’ His Dad (VIDEO/TWEETS) The death of Fox News Channel founder Roger Ailes on Thursday revealed beyond any doubt that nothing has changed at the fair and balanced network.

Deplorables Start Websites To Target Journalists Who ‘Don’t Behave’ (TWEETS) During the presidential campaign, a lot of journalists learned the hard way that speaking out against Donald Trump was a risky proposition.

Of all the crazy and asinine things I have ever seen in my life, this morning’s so-called ‘report’ on Good Morning America is the end of the end. They did a segment with a wannabe warrior man giving advice on how to survive office shootings. REALLY?! Apparently, workplace violence training is becoming a ‘thing.’

They recommend that when you are cornered you get aggressive and attack with anything you have – scissors, a letter opener – anything. Hurt the attacker with the gun by stabbing him or her in the face with a letter opener. Yep – you’ll live through that – NOT!

Here’s the deal – you want to survive office shootings? Don’t work in an office. Stay huddled in your damn house, afraid of your shadow because at any moment anyone in your outer-net can snap and shoot you dead. They can get their guns at Walmart and just get pissed at you because you spent too much time in the bathroom and shoot you dead. If you don’t get shot at work, you’ll get shot by your neighbor because you asked him not to mow the grass at 7:00 a.m.

Maybe you just spend too much time at the watercooler and your co-worker feels slighted because they had to answer the phone at your desk when your wife called for the 50th time to make sure you were at work. Maybe you teased the co-worker about a new hairstyle, or an ugly Christmas sweater.

The fact is, you can be involved in a weapons incident at work, at the mall, at the movie theater, picking your children up from elementary school, on the freeway stuck in rush hour traffic, at the supermarket picking up those last minute dinner rolls your wife forgot for your boss’ dinner party.

It doesn’t matter where you are or what you are doing. Any small perceived slight can cause someone to snap. Should you have to undergo office training akin to fire drills to learn how to protect yourself from crazy-ass mother fuckers with no regard for human life? Should you have to live your life in fear of the person at the next desk because you never know when they’re going to snap and become the next angry idiot with a gun and no common sense?

The short answer is NO. You should not. Our government – those people that were elected to be YOUR voice in Washington DC need to do their damn jobs. It is time for us, as citizens and voters, to hold them accountable for the mess they have created with their marriage to the NRA. It is an unholy union and it should be illegal. We need responsible gun regulations in this country and they need to be enforced. NOW.

The people that are supposed to represent you are being PAID big bucks to ignore your needs and desires and swing their vote to support the gun lobby so they can sell more guns to you. Their entire purpose is to keep you living in fear so you feel like you NEED that gun to protect yourself from your co-workers. YOU need to call them, email them, make their lives miserable until they start doing the job that you sent them to DC to do. And when the next election comes along you need to vote them out of office. Kick them to the curb. For a handy list of people and organizations the NRA hates – the NRA produces this handy list for you.

We need a revolution and we don’t need guns to get it done – we need an informed electorate that is passionate enough to GO VOTE. You have a voice and you have failed to use it. In this Democratic country, your elected officials (the people that make your laws) are being selected for you by a minority of uninformed voters that get up on election day and go to the polls, with their open-carry AR-15 slung across their shoulder and their trusty sidearm at their hip in a locking holster that they probably can’t get the gun out of anyway.

They select the person they see most on TV, regardless of their qualifications or who is paying them. That small 20-40 percent of people have been selecting your government while 60-80 percent of you stay home on voting day and say your vote doesn’t matter.

IT WOULD IF YOU USED IT DUMBASS!

HELLOOOO. In case you flunked math – 60-80 percent is BIGGER than 20-40 percent. The MAJORITY of people in this country (the ones staying home on election day) could very easily retake our government within two election cycles. Just go vote.









Four years – in four years you can make a difference – but you need to start today. When you step forward, these idiots that are in Congressional office voting and taking money for the corporations and the gun lobby will tuck their tails between their butt cheeks and run, scared. They will run away from an informed electorate that has had enough, probably peeing their pants as they scurry away.

The people that are supposed to represent you are being PAID big bucks to ignore your needs and desires and swing their vote to support the gun lobby so they can sell more guns to you. Their entire purpose is to keep you living in fear so you feel like you NEED that gun to protect yourself from your co-workers. YOU need to call them, email them, make their lives miserable until they start doing the job that you sent them to DC to do. And when the next election comes along you need to vote them out of office. Kick them to the curb. For a handy list of people and organizations the NRA hates – the NRA produces this handy list for you.

We need a revolution and we don’t need guns to get it done – we need an informed electorate that is passionate enough to GO VOTE. You have a voice and you have failed to use it. In this Democratic country, your elected officials (the people that make your laws) are being selected for you by a minority of uninformed voters that get up on election day and go to the polls, with their open-carry AR-15 slung across their shoulder and their trusty sidearm at their hip in a locking holster that they probably can’t get the gun out of anyway.

They select the person they see most on TV, regardless of their qualifications or who is paying them. That small 20-40 percent of people have been selecting your government while 60-80 percent of you stay home on voting day and say your vote doesn’t matter.

IT WOULD IF YOU USED IT DUMBASS!

HELLOOOO. In case you flunked math – 60-80 percent is BIGGER than 20-40 percent. The MAJORITY of people in this country (the ones staying home on election day) could very easily retake our government within two election cycles. Just go vote.









Four years – in four years you can make a difference – but you need to start today. When you step forward, these idiots that are in Congressional office voting and taking money for the corporations and the gun lobby will tuck their tails between their butt cheeks and run, scared. They will run away from an informed electorate that has had enough, probably peeing their pants as they scurry away.

We have seen a surge in hate against the transgender community this month. First, North Carolina passed their widely-hated bill, HB2. It forces transgender people to use the bathroom corresponding to the gender they were born with, not the gender they identify with now.

Many companies and musical acts are boycotting the state. Even President Obama has spoken out against this bill. Just this week, a town in Alabama has passed their own “bathroom” ordinance that can send transgender people to jail for using the “wrong” bathroom.

A transgender suicide hotline in North Carolina, Trans Lifeline, has had a HUGE spike in calls since this law has passed. They are the only transgender crisis hotline in the United States.

Here is the TransLifeline Mission Statement:

“Trans Lifeline works to end transgender suicide and improve the overall mental health of transgender people through education, advocacy, and direct service. We empower trans people to help one another, and to shape our collective efforts by drawing upon our wealth of individual experiences.”

Forty-one percent of transgender people will attempt suicide at least once in their lifetime. Comparatively, only less than five percent of the general population will attempt suicide.

A local psychotherapist, Dr. Leon Johnson, had this to say:

“We have to look at what is best for that community, so that we can help them transition and be able to be a part of the existing community that they are living in, that they are working in.”

The co-founder of Trans Lifeline, Greta Gustava Martela, says that they would normally have an upswing in calls around this time of year. She says that suicide rates rise in the spring, but this is WAY more than normal, which indicates that a specific event is causing the upswing.









These people already have to struggle with trying to be who they are. Many of them are in pain, and they need help. Hopefully, this hotline can help them find the resources they need.

If you or a loved one is transgender and needs someone to talk to, call (877) 565-8860.

Back in 1980 when Ronald Reagan was elected I was so angry and disappointed that I swore off politics. I was especially disappointed in my formerly liberal and democratic parents for falling for what, at the time, I thought was nothing more than Republican propaganda. Republicans were ecstatic.

During the Reagan presidency I focused on myself and my life. I worked, I got married, I had a child and my life was good. While I reveled in the failures and scandals of the Reagan administration (the Reagan recession, Iran/Contra, tax increases, etc.) I still continued to not participate in the political process, I was still young and didn’t understand how really important politics was.

Republicans, however, seemed pretty happy. The government was spending money on all the things they wanted government to spend money on, even though it tripled the national debt.

Fast forward, 1992, Bill Clinton gets elected. I’m very happy (even though I didn’t vote), Republicans are pissed.

During the Clinton years I thrived, the country thrived. The economy boomed. Republicans got even more pissed. They shut down the government and even tried to impeach the president, even though Clinton signed the Telecommunication Deregulation act and the NAFTA trade agreement.

Then, in 2000, George W Bush gets elected. Little George follows the Reagan model; tax cuts for the rich with a recession to follow. Are Republicans happy? They seem to be a little happier but not as happy as you might expect. They start passing laws that hurt the middle class even more. Changes that will result in the closing of more than 50,000 factories in this country.

Then 9/11 happens. We invade Afghanistan and go after al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden (the son of a good friend of the Bush family). Then we invade (illegally) Iraq based on lies. We start spending billions of dollars with the American military/industrial complex prosecuting these wars. Republicans are happy, but again, not as happy as they could be. They still seem to want to pass laws to hurt the American middle class, not to mention the poor in this country.

The wars drag on and Americans grow increasingly tired. In 2008 Barack Obama is elected with a Democratic congress. Republicans are now really, really pissed. On the day of his inauguration Republican leaders meet and conspire to make him a one term president.

In his first two years as president Obama accomplishes two really important things: he signs the Affordable Care Act and bails out the auto industry. Obama is actually helping ordinary Americans and Republican heads are exploding. This has got to stop.

So, for the 2010 midterm elections Republicans cranked up their propaganda machine, spent millions, and took over the House of Representatives. Now the games really begin. For the next two years very, very little gets done. Obama tries to compromise with republicans and is rebuffed at every turn. Republicans in the senate start their filibuster strategy to stop everything the Democratic Party proposes.

2012 comes and the Republicans choose Willard “Mitt” Romney and Paul Ryan to carry their flag. Billions of dollars flow into the Republican coffers for the campaign. They are confident, certain they’re going to win. They lose. They are utterly surprised. But they did retain control of the House of Representatives, and they’re even angrier than ever. The obstruction didn’t just continue, it increased in its fervency. More and more bills in the Senate were blocked by Republican filibusters. By the end of the 113th congress more filibusters occurred in the Senate in the previous 4 years than all other filibusters combined for all other presidents since George Washington. A monumental do-nothing congress. Republicans even shut down the government in late 2013.

However, in spite of the best efforts of the Republicans the economy is improving dramatically. The American auto industry is back on top, employment is going up, the deficit is dropping, and the stock market is setting new records. And Obama starts to use his executive powers to get things done. And in 2014, because of the ACA, the number of people without health insurance drops to its lowest ever. Obamacare is a success, in spite of the 54 votes in the House to overturn it.









Now, you would think that the Democrats would take advantage of these successes during the 2014 elections, but they didn’t. Instead, because the corporate media was telling everyone how unpopular the president was, most Democrats ran away from the president. Big mistake. Americans were so fed up with politics and Washington that only 37% of registered voters turned out to vote. Republicans won big and took over both houses of congress.

Republicans should finally be happy right? They are giddy about their new found majority in congress but their anger doesn’t seem to be assuaged. In fact, they seem even more determined to take out their anger on the American people. One of their first acts is to cut Social Security payments to the disabled among us.

So I began to wonder if there could be some other reason for their anger. I wondered if there might have been something else that happened in 1992 other than Clinton’s election that could be the source of this anger. Then one day with a bit of serendipity I figured it out. 1992 was the year that the 27th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified.

To understand why this is so important you have to remember that back in the 80’s every two years a new session of congress would begin and the first thing the new congress would do is give themselves a pay raise. The 27th Amendment put an end to that practice and Republicans have been pissed off ever since.

Amendment XXVII

No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened."

Colorado is tougher on unlicensed hairdressers than Arizona is on unlicensed attorneys.

Colorado must be a very conscientious state. In Colorado, Suzette Hall was arrested for suspicion of practicing cosmetology without a license. I am assuming it is because she was practicing her craft sans a trendy burnout tee from the Sundance Catalog; or a shirt of any kind. Whether toplessness constitutes reasonable suspicion to believe that one does not have a license to practice one’s chosen profession in Colorado, much less probable cause for an arrest, I will leave to the authorities in Colorado.

By contrast, you cannot get arrested in Arizona for practicing law without a license, clothed or otherwise. Since we have had a multitude of topless demonstrations in Tempe and Phoenix in the recent past, I think it might be safe to say that Ms. Hall could have declared herself a topless lawyer in Arizona without fear of arrest.

Foolishly, I thought I would have to have a license in Arizona to call myself a lawyer in Arizona state court. I paid in excess of $2000 and went through a rigorous criminal and character background investigation lasting 6 months to get my Arizona law license. But it turns out that everybody, including the trial courts in the county with the biggest glut of death penalty cases Arizona has ever seen, can and did call whoever they wanted to a lawyer, with no criminal or other penalty whatsoever.

This is in stark contrast to Texas, known as that other crazy, red, Wild West state. I have been licensed to practice law in Texas for 20 years. It is a third degree felony to practice law without a license and get paid to do so, punishable by two to ten years in prison. In Arizona, it is a violation of Arizona State Bar Rules, but it is not a crime.

The reason it is not illegal to practice law without a license in Arizona is because a real estate agent was once convicted of practicing law without a license in the 1960s. This is all discussed at length in a 2002 law review article by law professor Jonathan Rose entitled: ?Unauthorized Practice of Law: A Legal and Political Problem That Won?t Go Away.? Because realtors lobbied the legislature, the statute criminalizing the unauthorized practice of law in Arizona went away in the eighties. It has not been a crime to practice law without a license in Arizona since 1984. You cannot even get the equivalent of a parking ticket for doing it.

When my husband moved us from Austin, Texas, to Scottsdale, Arizona, in August 2011, I had a lot of trepidation about coming here. Maricopa County’s reputation for lawless insanity precedes it. County Attorney Andrew Thomas, the equivalent of the district attorney in other jurisdictions, was being disbarred for charging other public officials with nonexistent crimes when we got to Arizona. Sheriff Joe Arpaio has now been found by a federal court to have violated the civil rights of scores of Hispanics. I knew that Arizona was a dicey place when it comes to federal Constitutional rights. I also knew that, despite having two criminal board certifications in Texas, I was going to have to start all over again in Arizona.

What happened next was so much worse than I expected.

I had a lovely interview with two female lawyers and the ?capital staff attorney? in early 2012. All seemed to go well, until the very end of the interview, when I was asked if I minded working with a ?paralegal.? I said no, of course not. It turned out that the paralegal they were referring to was the other Capital Staff Attorney, Diane Alessi.

I later received a confusing e-mail from the Presiding Criminal Judge, Douglas Rayes. He referred to Diane as a ?great lawyer and a wonderful person.? In my opinion, he was wrong on both counts.

There is not much worse than working with a jealous, competitive, non-collegial wannabe. I’ll spare everyone the gory details, but I went along with what I thought was a bizarre arrangement to begin with until I no longer could. Arizona Capital Staff Attorneys advise trial judges statewide on the law in death penalty cases. They write proposed orders and legal memoranda. I began to discover that some of the judges had no idea Diane was not a lawyer. In addition, a number of the judges were highly dependent upon us to tell them what the law is.

Maricopa County rotates its judges through four areas of practice, just one of which is criminal law. I was asked some surprisingly basic criminal law questions during my short tenure there. How could these judges have known that someone authorized by Court Administration to call themselves an ?attorney? was not licensed to practice law anywhere? Diane surrendered her bar card in Oregon in 1999. Yet, as of 2012, she was a working “attorney” in Arizona. For five years Diane advised judges statewide in a multitude of death penalty cases. The disbarred county attorney, Andrew Thomas, had 149 death penalty cases pending in Maricopa County alone. It was a busy time.

In one instance, a judge asking a question was so confused and confusing that I asked Diane, “What does she want?” Diane replied, “She wants me to make the decision for her.”

Then the thing I could not overlook finally happened: A grant request slid across my desk, drafted by Diane, asking the Arizona Supreme Court to give us a raise because:

The two staff attorneys currently funded by this grant each have extensive experience in capital litigation and have spent their entire legal careers specializing in criminal law.

The grant request referred to us at all times as attorneys, criminal attorneys, and criminal specialists. A distinction was made between “attorneys” and mere “law clerks.” The word ?specialist? is a legal term of art that refers to an individual who is board certified in a legal specialty. I chaired the Criminal Law Exam Commission in Texas, but I am not board certified in criminal law in Arizona. And I had never been a party to a fraud on a court in my entire career. My reputation in Texas was one of scrupulous honesty to the tribunal, any tribunal. Diane had previously told me, more than once, that we had the ?same credentials.? I never knew before I saw the grant request whether she actually believed that or not.

I ran the grant request by a judge I was friendly with in the office next to mine. He confirmed what I thought, that it was a grant fraud, and that I had to call the Arizona Bar Ethics Hotline and ask them what to do next. I made the call, and I was told I had to report this matter to the Bar. I did.

I later found out that the Bar called my supervisor, Court Administrator and attorney Karen Westover, the same day I reported the grant fraud and unauthorized practice of law. Karen took me for a ride in her personal vehicle and asked me if I had reported Diane to the bar, without telling me that the bar had already contacted Karen. I did not lie. Three business days later, Judge Rayes called me into his office and forced me to resign effective immediately.

Judge Rayes is now a nominee for a vacant federal court bench in Arizona, so illegally terminating me has had zero adverse impact on his career. In a ?Right to Work? state, you can fire a person for any reason or no reason at all. What you cannot do is fire them for an illegal reason; like blowing the whistle on grant fraud. I, on the other hand, have not worked as an attorney in Arizona since, despite being the one person in this entire mess who told the truth or did what was legally required of me.

While that was bad enough, what happened next shocked me even more.

I reported the grant fraud to the Maricopa County Attorney, Chief Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court Rebecca White Berch (formerly an Associate and Partner at McGroder, Tryon, Heller, Rayes & Berch), as well as the FBI, in case the grant funds were federal. I do not want to go to federal prison for failing to report a federal crime, which is itself a federal crime.

Communications with the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office yielded the expected nothing. The FBI said I had acquitted myself of my duty to report a potential federal crime. But then I got an oddly worded letter from the Arizona Supreme Court’s Chief Staff Attorney, Ellen Crowley, who said:

?With respect to your concern about the CPAF [Case Processing Assistance Fund] Grant Funds, I note that the [grant] application you attached to your letter is unsigned and does not indicate where (or whether) it was actually filed.

This answer shocked me because the signed and file-stamped original was on file with . . . drum roll please . . . the Arizona Supreme Court.

The Administrative Office of the Courts, which the Chief Justice oversees, took swift action. They changed the parameters of the projects for which CPAF Grant Funds can be used to include the ?Arizona Capital Law Clerks Assistance Project,? and changed Diane’s title to, ?Capital Litigation Law Clerk.? She got her raise and she still has her job. Like magic, a reverse ex post facto cover-up happened.

Almost a year after I reported what I believed to be a crime against the People of Arizona, the State Bar of Arizona entered into an unpublished ?Consent Decree? against Diane Alessi, in which she admits to having committed certain prohibited acts, generally denies everything else, and agrees to forever more refrain from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law or using a title that would lead a person to believe she is, in fact, an attorney. Since she is not a member of the State Bar, this decree is not confidential. But it was also not made public by publication on the Arizona State Bar website.

Diane’s defense in the beginning was that (1) her employers allowed her to use this title, which is absolutely true; and (2) she never told anyone she was a licensed attorney, as opposed to the other kind. I hope we have not gotten to the point in this world where it is legal to claim to be a surgeon or an airline pilot, as long as you omit the word, ?licensed.? Diane used to be an attorney, and even though it was more than a decade ago, she should have known better. None of her co-conspirators in perpetrating this fraud were in any way disciplined or prosecuted. Diane took a rubber bullet for the whole team.

Judge Rayes, for his part, did a 180 degree about-face from the e-mail he sent to me, acting like he barely knew Diane in a letter which Diane’s attorney forwarded to the Arizona State Bar:

My duties as Presiding Criminal Judge for the Arizona Superior Court, Maricopa County, require that I work with Ms. Alessi.

He went on to say he had no idea how anybody outside of the judiciary would get the idea that Diane was an attorney ? forget that the judges themselves might be misled by what used to appear on the Arizona Supreme Court’s website. Or that Diane spoke at continuing legal education programs for judges who had just rotated into criminal law and attorneys using the title ?Capital Staff Attorney.? Or that she co-authored papers with judges using the title, ?Capital Staff Attorney.? Or that she is referred to in the minutes of a meeting of the Arizona Supreme Court Capital Oversight Committee, which is composed of people who are not all judges, as the Capital Staff Attorney. Or in court orders that went to the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco and beyond, which are all public documents, wherein she was listed as ?Diane Alessi, Capital Case Staff Attorney, Arizona Death Penalty Judicial Assistance Program.? And forget that all of these materials can be found on the Internet by anybody on planet Earth.

I think it bears repeating that Judge Rayes is on the fast track to becoming a federal judge in Arizona. I requested his assistance with the problem I seem to be having getting another job in my field in Arizona. So far, I have received no response. As in zero. But his dishonesty, coupled with his completely implausible cover story, leads me to believe he does not have the intellectual or moral acuity to do that job. And by that I do not mean that he is not intelligent. Just that he does not possess that very high level of intellect and character one would expect with a judge with that kind of lifetime-tenured power.

In summary, there is no need to settle for being an incarcerated non-licensed topless hairdresser in Colorado, when you can be a non-licensed attorney in Arizona with no fear of arrest or conviction, making $72,000 a year on the taxpayer’s dime. If anybody is foolish enough to turn you in, out of some misplaced sense of ethical obligation or pride in their chosen profession, or a desire not to go to prison for being an unwilling co-conspirator to grant fraud, the whistleblower will be terminated from their job and never work again. Other actual lawyers, including the state Supreme Court and a federal judicial nominee, will cover for you. The State Bar will slap you on the hand. And scores of people will even be legally executed based upon years of legal advice you were not licensed to give.

As a lawyer friend of mine once said about her own upward mobility from Cajun teenager living in the sticks to Harvard educated lawyer:

?Isn’t America a great country?

Only in Republican America, in states run by the Republican right, can a non-licensed topless hairdresser from Colorado theoretically aspire to be a non-licensed attorney in Arizona. Every one of the people involved in what happened to me, except possibly Diane herself, is a Republican. If you are licensed to practice law, but are banned for life by the SEC and under investigation by the feds; as well as disposed to hiring extramarital lovers whose law licenses have been suspended for attorney positions, or have other girlfriends running your allegedly independent PAC; and are spotted by the Feds committing a hit and run after a nooner with a possible temporarily topless lawyer: You can even be Arizona Attorney General. Your dream can be as big as the Grand Canyon in Arizona, just as long as you are not doing the right thing.

There is not much worse than working with a jealous, competitive, non-collegial wannabe. I’ll spare everyone the gory details, but I went along with what I thought was a bizarre arrangement to begin with until I no longer could. Arizona Capital Staff Attorneys advise trial judges statewide on the law in death penalty cases. They write proposed orders and legal memoranda. I began to discover that some of the judges had no idea Diane was not a lawyer. In addition, a number of the judges were highly dependent upon us to tell them what the law is.

Maricopa County rotates its judges through four areas of practice, just one of which is criminal law. I was asked some surprisingly basic criminal law questions during my short tenure there. How could these judges have known that someone authorized by Court Administration to call themselves an ?attorney? was not licensed to practice law anywhere? Diane surrendered her bar card in Oregon in 1999. Yet, as of 2012, she was a working “attorney” in Arizona. For five years Diane advised judges statewide in a multitude of death penalty cases. The disbarred county attorney, Andrew Thomas, had 149 death penalty cases pending in Maricopa County alone. It was a busy time.

In one instance, a judge asking a question was so confused and confusing that I asked Diane, “What does she want?” Diane replied, “She wants me to make the decision for her.”

Then the thing I could not overlook finally happened: A grant request slid across my desk, drafted by Diane, asking the Arizona Supreme Court to give us a raise because:

The two staff attorneys currently funded by this grant each have extensive experience in capital litigation and have spent their entire legal careers specializing in criminal law.

The grant request referred to us at all times as attorneys, criminal attorneys, and criminal specialists. A distinction was made between “attorneys” and mere “law clerks.” The word ?specialist? is a legal term of art that refers to an individual who is board certified in a legal specialty. I chaired the Criminal Law Exam Commission in Texas, but I am not board certified in criminal law in Arizona. And I had never been a party to a fraud on a court in my entire career. My reputation in Texas was one of scrupulous honesty to the tribunal, any tribunal. Diane had previously told me, more than once, that we had the ?same credentials.? I never knew before I saw the grant request whether she actually believed that or not.

I ran the grant request by a judge I was friendly with in the office next to mine. He confirmed what I thought, that it was a grant fraud, and that I had to call the Arizona Bar Ethics Hotline and ask them what to do next. I made the call, and I was told I had to report this matter to the Bar. I did.

I later found out that the Bar called my supervisor, Court Administrator and attorney Karen Westover, the same day I reported the grant fraud and unauthorized practice of law. Karen took me for a ride in her personal vehicle and asked me if I had reported Diane to the bar, without telling me that the bar had already contacted Karen. I did not lie. Three business days later, Judge Rayes called me into his office and forced me to resign effective immediately.

Judge Rayes is now a nominee for a vacant federal court bench in Arizona, so illegally terminating me has had zero adverse impact on his career. In a ?Right to Work? state, you can fire a person for any reason or no reason at all. What you cannot do is fire them for an illegal reason; like blowing the whistle on grant fraud. I, on the other hand, have not worked as an attorney in Arizona since, despite being the one person in this entire mess who told the truth or did what was legally required of me.

While that was bad enough, what happened next shocked me even more.

I reported the grant fraud to the Maricopa County Attorney, Chief Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court Rebecca White Berch (formerly an Associate and Partner at McGroder, Tryon, Heller, Rayes & Berch), as well as the FBI, in case the grant funds were federal. I do not want to go to federal prison for failing to report a federal crime, which is itself a federal crime.

Communications with the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office yielded the expected nothing. The FBI said I had acquitted myself of my duty to report a potential federal crime. But then I got an oddly worded letter from the Arizona Supreme Court’s Chief Staff Attorney, Ellen Crowley, who said:

?With respect to your concern about the CPAF [Case Processing Assistance Fund] Grant Funds, I note that the [grant] application you attached to your letter is unsigned and does not indicate where (or whether) it was actually filed.

This answer shocked me because the signed and file-stamped original was on file with . . . drum roll please . . . the Arizona Supreme Court.

The Administrative Office of the Courts, which the Chief Justice oversees, took swift action. They changed the parameters of the projects for which CPAF Grant Funds can be used to include the ?Arizona Capital Law Clerks Assistance Project,? and changed Diane’s title to, ?Capital Litigation Law Clerk.? She got her raise and she still has her job. Like magic, a reverse ex post facto cover-up happened.

Almost a year after I reported what I believed to be a crime against the People of Arizona, the State Bar of Arizona entered into an unpublished ?Consent Decree? against Diane Alessi, in which she admits to having committed certain prohibited acts, generally denies everything else, and agrees to forever more refrain from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law or using a title that would lead a person to believe she is, in fact, an attorney. Since she is not a member of the State Bar, this decree is not confidential. But it was also not made public by publication on the Arizona State Bar website.

Diane’s defense in the beginning was that (1) her employers allowed her to use this title, which is absolutely true; and (2) she never told anyone she was a licensed attorney, as opposed to the other kind. I hope we have not gotten to the point in this world where it is legal to claim to be a surgeon or an airline pilot, as long as you omit the word, ?licensed.? Diane used to be an attorney, and even though it was more than a decade ago, she should have known better. None of her co-conspirators in perpetrating this fraud were in any way disciplined or prosecuted. Diane took a rubber bullet for the whole team.

Judge Rayes, for his part, did a 180 degree about-face from the e-mail he sent to me, acting like he barely knew Diane in a letter which Diane’s attorney forwarded to the Arizona State Bar:

My duties as Presiding Criminal Judge for the Arizona Superior Court, Maricopa County, require that I work with Ms. Alessi.

He went on to say he had no idea how anybody outside of the judiciary would get the idea that Diane was an attorney ? forget that the judges themselves might be misled by what used to appear on the Arizona Supreme Court’s website. Or that Diane spoke at continuing legal education programs for judges who had just rotated into criminal law and attorneys using the title ?Capital Staff Attorney.? Or that she co-authored papers with judges using the title, ?Capital Staff Attorney.? Or that she is referred to in the minutes of a meeting of the Arizona Supreme Court Capital Oversight Committee, which is composed of people who are not all judges, as the Capital Staff Attorney. Or in court orders that went to the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco and beyond, which are all public documents, wherein she was listed as ?Diane Alessi, Capital Case Staff Attorney, Arizona Death Penalty Judicial Assistance Program.? And forget that all of these materials can be found on the Internet by anybody on planet Earth.

I think it bears repeating that Judge Rayes is on the fast track to becoming a federal judge in Arizona. I requested his assistance with the problem I seem to be having getting another job in my field in Arizona. So far, I have received no response. As in zero. But his dishonesty, coupled with his completely implausible cover story, leads me to believe he does not have the intellectual or moral acuity to do that job. And by that I do not mean that he is not intelligent. Just that he does not possess that very high level of intellect and character one would expect with a judge with that kind of lifetime-tenured power.

In summary, there is no need to settle for being an incarcerated non-licensed topless hairdresser in Colorado, when you can be a non-licensed attorney in Arizona with no fear of arrest or conviction, making $72,000 a year on the taxpayer’s dime. If anybody is foolish enough to turn you in, out of some misplaced sense of ethical obligation or pride in their chosen profession, or a desire not to go to prison for being an unwilling co-conspirator to grant fraud, the whistleblower will be terminated from their job and never work again. Other actual lawyers, including the state Supreme Court and a federal judicial nominee, will cover for you. The State Bar will slap you on the hand. And scores of people will even be legally executed based upon years of legal advice you were not licensed to give.

As a lawyer friend of mine once said about her own upward mobility from Cajun teenager living in the sticks to Harvard educated lawyer:

?Isn’t America a great country?

Only in Republican America, in states run by the Republican right, can a non-licensed topless hairdresser from Colorado theoretically aspire to be a non-licensed attorney in Arizona. Every one of the people involved in what happened to me, except possibly Diane herself, is a Republican. If you are licensed to practice law, but are banned for life by the SEC and under investigation by the feds; as well as disposed to hiring extramarital lovers whose law licenses have been suspended for attorney positions, or have other girlfriends running your allegedly independent PAC; and are spotted by the Feds committing a hit and run after a nooner with a possible temporarily topless lawyer: You can even be Arizona Attorney General. Your dream can be as big as the Grand Canyon in Arizona, just as long as you are not doing the right thing.

It’s always a triumph for democracy when more people become involved in the process of electing their candidates into the various political offices, but not as walking ‘white-power’ billboards.

In Fayetteville, North Carolina, the Tilly family doesn’t have a history of being active in politics. However, every member of the family – both old and young – has ample motivation to vote for or vigorously campaign for the first time – for Donald Trump.

While this story, which ran on PBS, seems heartwarming enough; you may begin to have serious doubts when you consider that Grace – one of the central characters of this story is a walking white-power billboard.

Grace has huge white-power tattoos covering each hand. One of these tattoos – a version of the Celtic Cross, which covers her right hand, is one of the most commonly used white supremacist symbols. This much was confirmed by Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow at the ADL (Anti-Defamation League), who states that:

“The Celtic Cross is an ancient and revered Christian symbol typically not associated with extremism at all. However, one particular version of the Celtic Cross—a squarish cross with a thick circle intersecting with it (also known as Odin’s Cross), has become one of the most popular white supremacist symbols around. In the past 20 years, its popularity has done little but grow, thanks to its use as the logo by Stormfront, the largest white supremacist website in the world.”

Another PBS shot captured the “88” symbol on her left hand. The ADL clearly states that:

“88 is a white supremacist numerical code for ‘Heil Hitler.’”

Finally, the connection has been made, and it’s pretty much sealed at this point that America may see something of a Hitler-like control from Trump, based on his supporters’ antecedents.









Perhaps the most telling action taken in all this show of “Trump-ishness” is that Grace didn’t even try hiding her tattoos.

This is sure getting interesting don’t you think?

Who Was Thomas Paine?

According to Wikipedia, Thomas Paine was an English-American political activist, philosopher, author, political theorist and revolutionary. As the author of two highly influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution, he inspired the patriots in 1776 to declare independence from Britain. His ideas reflected the Enlightenment-era rhetoric of transnational human rights. He has been called “a corset-maker by trade, a journalist by profession, and a propagandist by inclination.” Moreover, he promoted reason and freethinking and argued against institutionalized religion in general, and Christian doctrine in particular.?What would Thomas Paine say if he were alive today? What would his views be on corporations as people, and money equaling free speech? Would he approve or is he turning over in his grave?

Would the recent Hobby Lobby case cause him to take the stump and put pen to paper, or would he affirm the decision? Based on this writer’s research the answer to these questions would be an emphatic, no. Paine’s early activism caught the eye of then statesmen Benjamin Franklin. Ironically, Paine’s early activism centered around better pay for the working class in his home country of Britain. Thomas Paine moved to America mainly because he was a failure in many of his endeavors in Britain and America offered him a fresh start. Once in America, he began working as a journalist. The breakout of the American Revolutionary War gave Paine the chance to define in print the purpose of the war that to many had remained ambiguous. This condition of not knowing what the American colonies were fighting for inspired his most famous literary work entitled “Common Sense.”

In this writer’s view, “Common Sense” was the first litmus test on how political activism and journalism could co-mingle themselves not only to educate the unknowing masses, but to actuate change in public thinking which resulted in changing public policy that in this case, led to the American Revolutionary War. What to this day is a little-known fact is that only a third of the organizers of the rebellion in America were for total independence. It was not until the publishing of Common Sense that the tide swung and what resulted was the Declaration of Independence.

I offered nothing more than simple facts, plain arguments, and Common Sense. [Thomas Paine, 1776]

It was this pamphlet that stirred the public discourse to such a point that it brought about the desired recourse for We The People.

“The American people owe their liberty to Thomas Paine more than any other man.” [George Washington]

















One of Thomas Paine’s most famous quotes:

“There are times that try men’s souls.”?

Are we not living in such times today? We have a high court that places more regulations on a female’s vagina than on weapons of mass destruction in the hands of mental incompetents. Also, we have a high court through judicial over-reach entirely ignoring the separation of church and state doctrine in our constitution. In fact, the behavior of the U.S. Supreme Court mirrors the actions of the British monarchy of Paine’s time. We have an attack of the rights of workers in this country that was the genesis of Paine becoming politically active in the first place. What was a British monarchy in 1776 has become a corporate monarchy in 2015. With everyday citizens losing rights on a daily basis to corporate -bought legislative tactics, such as “right to work,” “voter ID laws,” and gerrymandering just to name a few, these are truly times that can try a man’s soul.



Just like today, conservative thinkers of Paine’s time found him bothersome. John Adams called Thomas Paine a mongrel. Just like today, when you have politicians like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Christian zealots applauding the Hobby Lobby decision for upholding so-called religious liberty at the expense of everyone else, we see our present condition here in America reverting to a truism this writer holds dear, “history does repeat itself.” Conservatives of Thomas Paine’s times are no different than modern-day conservatives. They fear change.

In closing, the important thing and example that Thomas Paine’s story teaches us is that we must, as individuals, make a mark for ourselves on what we stand for and believe. No matter how insignificant you may feel your voice crying in the wilderness might be, its the collective voices crying together that can become a roar and affect change. What would Thomas Paine say if he were alive today? Rise America, participate in the voting process; these are times that try men’s souls. Use your common sense with reason.

Who Was Thomas Paine?

According to Wikipedia, Thomas Paine was an English-American political activist, philosopher, author, political theorist and revolutionary. As the author of two highly influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution, he inspired the patriots in 1776 to declare independence from Britain. His ideas reflected the Enlightenment-era rhetoric of transnational human rights. He has been called “a corset-maker by trade, a journalist by profession, and a propagandist by inclination.” Moreover, he promoted reason and freethinking and argued against institutionalized religion in general, and Christian doctrine in particular.?What would Thomas Paine say if he were alive today? What would his views be on corporations as people, and money equaling free speech? Would he approve or is he turning over in his grave?

Would the recent Hobby Lobby case cause him to take the stump and put pen to paper, or would he affirm the decision? Based on this writer’s research the answer to these questions would be an emphatic, no. Paine’s early activism caught the eye of then statesmen Benjamin Franklin. Ironically, Paine’s early activism centered around better pay for the working class in his home country of Britain. Thomas Paine moved to America mainly because he was a failure in many of his endeavors in Britain and America offered him a fresh start. Once in America, he began working as a journalist. The breakout of the American Revolutionary War gave Paine the chance to define in print the purpose of the war that to many had remained ambiguous. This condition of not knowing what the American colonies were fighting for inspired his most famous literary work entitled “Common Sense.”

In this writer’s view, “Common Sense” was the first litmus test on how political activism and journalism could co-mingle themselves not only to educate the unknowing masses, but to actuate change in public thinking which resulted in changing public policy that in this case, led to the American Revolutionary War. What to this day is a little-known fact is that only a third of the organizers of the rebellion in America were for total independence. It was not until the publishing of Common Sense that the tide swung and what resulted was the Declaration of Independence.

I offered nothing more than simple facts, plain arguments, and Common Sense. [Thomas Paine, 1776]

It was this pamphlet that stirred the public discourse to such a point that it brought about the desired recourse for We The People.

“The American people owe their liberty to Thomas Paine more than any other man.” [George Washington]

















One of Thomas Paine’s most famous quotes:

“There are times that try men’s souls.”?

Are we not living in such times today? We have a high court that places more regulations on a female’s vagina than on weapons of mass destruction in the hands of mental incompetents. Also, we have a high court through judicial over-reach entirely ignoring the separation of church and state doctrine in our constitution. In fact, the behavior of the U.S. Supreme Court mirrors the actions of the British monarchy of Paine’s time. We have an attack of the rights of workers in this country that was the genesis of Paine becoming politically active in the first place. What was a British monarchy in 1776 has become a corporate monarchy in 2015. With everyday citizens losing rights on a daily basis to corporate -bought legislative tactics, such as “right to work,” “voter ID laws,” and gerrymandering just to name a few, these are truly times that can try a man’s soul.



Just like today, conservative thinkers of Paine’s time found him bothersome. John Adams called Thomas Paine a mongrel. Just like today, when you have politicians like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Christian zealots applauding the Hobby Lobby decision for upholding so-called religious liberty at the expense of everyone else, we see our present condition here in America reverting to a truism this writer holds dear, “history does repeat itself.” Conservatives of Thomas Paine’s times are no different than modern-day conservatives. They fear change.

In closing, the important thing and example that Thomas Paine’s story teaches us is that we must, as individuals, make a mark for ourselves on what we stand for and believe. No matter how insignificant you may feel your voice crying in the wilderness might be, its the collective voices crying together that can become a roar and affect change. What would Thomas Paine say if he were alive today? Rise America, participate in the voting process; these are times that try men’s souls. Use your common sense with reason.

One woman’s kind gesture has demonstrated that the holiday season really does bring out the best in people.

At a McDonald’s drive thru in Florida Torie Keene embraced the holiday spirit by paying for the meal of the car behind her. This gesture of goodwill then sparked a chain of 250 people who all happily paid for the meal of the stranger behind them.

Marisabel Figueroa, the cashier at the Lakeland McDonald’s, had been specifically told to say “Merry Christmas” instead of “Happy Holidays” when speaking to customers in a bid to spread the Christmas cheer.

This certainly seemed to do the trick as Keene responded by telling Figueroa that she wanted to pay for the following car’s meal and wish them a “Merry Christmas.”

Figueroa claims that when she told the following car that their meal had already been paid for the passenger was so touched by the gesture of goodwill that she decided she would pay for the meal of those in the following car.

This sparked a chain reaction at the drive thru as 250 consecutive cars happily paid for the following person’s meal with one woman even generously paying for the meals of the next three cars.









Figueroa worked a six hour shift and claimed that the chain lasted for almost the entire duration. She stated that because it just “kept going and going” she decided to keep count, saying:

“After the 15th car I started tally marking the number of people that were participating on a piece of paper.”

Keene was shocked at the continuous chain of kindness that her gesture sparked and said she was only attempting to “brighten someone’s day.”

Keene was not the only person who was surprised by the multiple acts of kindness demonstrated by the cars at the drive thru. Figuerosa stated that every passenger whose meal was paid for was “so stunned and so happy” and that she has “never experienced something like that” in the 12 years that she has worked there.

Michelle Obama’s project as First Lady has been to get kids moving. To set a good example, she has tweeted a video of her intense workouts, and I imagine there are going to be some people crying “Scandal!” when they see her in stretch pants and tank top!

The First Lady shows off her workout skills jumping rope, working a medicine ball, squats with a bench, lifting 35-pound weights, and putting some gloves on and kick boxing.

It also includes many firsts for a First Lady. According to The Washington Post, she is the first to show her workout routine and wear a tank top and stretch pants. I’m waiting for the comments to trickle down about the evil of stretch pants/yoga pants.









What’s even more awesome is that you actually get to see her physique. How many hateful conservatives have called her fat, have called her “Moochelle”? Sorry guys, the First Lady is smokin’ hot. Considering her arms look like she could beat the hell out of someone, they might want to get the hush mouth.

So check out our First Lady workin’ out.You can watch the video below!

I laughed myself silly over a little video that showed a crow doing what crows do. But who knew how amazing these birds really are? So I want to share that video with you – and several other crow video gems. Have fun!

Crows make people around the world laugh. How do they do it?

a. They find a sled and go sledding









b. They go out and get drunk

c. They go horseback riding.

Watch this little video to see which one is true. (It’s okay to laugh yourself silly.)

When we hear we have to ‘eat crow,’ that brings up some unhappy feelings. ?Eat crow? leads us to believe that crows taste awful. So what do they really taste like?

a. Skunk meat

b. Just like chicken

c. Wild duck

Surprisingly eating crow doesn’t taste bad. It takes like wild duck.

This crow wants this guy’s little frying pan. How does it try to get it?

a. Ask for it

b. Trick the man out of it

c. Get frustrated and give up

Check out this amazing bird in action! It is really funny.

4. What do you call a whole bunch of crows?

a. A murder of crows

b. A gaggle of crows

c. A gurgle of crows









Fortunately you see a murder of crows – but not a gang of murdering crows.

5. If a city crow smarter than a human toddler wants to crack a nut, what does he do?

a. Drop it from a high building

Just when you thought the Ray Rice affair couldn’t get more offensive, it probably did. It now appears that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell initially suspended Rice for two games for hitting his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, because he didn’t want to drag Janay’s name through the mud–even after Rice told Goodell he’d hit Janay.













On Thursday, an anonymous NFL owner told The Wall Street Journal about several private conversations Goodell had held with him and several other owners about the Rice affair. According to the unnamed owner, Goodell said that when he met with Ray and Janay Rice (as they now were–they married in March) on June 16, Janay said she hit Rice first and felt she was partly to blame for what happened in the elevator of the Revel casino in Atlantic City. The anonymous?owner said that Goodell initially believed that Janay had become unconscious when she fell during the scuffle. When Goodell handed down the original two-game suspension, the commissioner felt that if he doubted Janay’s story, he would have come across as smearing Janay’s character. According to two other people familiar with the reasoning Goodell initially used to justify the original suspension, Goodell soft-pedaled the investigation because he was reluctant to challenge Janay’s version of events. However, just a few hours before The Journal’s story went online, ESPN’s Don Van Natta reported that later on June 16, Rice admitted to Goodell that he hit Janay and knocked her out.

So let’s see if we’ve got this right. Even after Rice admitted that he’d hit Janay, Goodell wasn’t willing to question Janay’s claim that she was partly responsible for the scuffle in the elevator. Goodell then gave Rice an insultingly short “suspension” of two games because anything longer than that would have come off as challenging Janay’s character. If you’re having trouble getting your head around this, don’t worry. So am I.

Goodell’s meeting with the Rices broke every rule on how domestic violence should be investigated. According to Deadspin’s Barry Petchetsky, anything Janay said–especially with Rice in the room–should have been taken with a generous helping of salt. A victim taking responsibility for abuse is a textbook case of battered-spouse syndrome. I know. I experienced it firsthand during my own three-year experience with an abusive marriage. There were times I wanted to leave, and I was afraid to because part of me thought I wasn’t doing enough to keep our marriage together. Petchetsky points out that anyone experienced with domestic violence would know that victims will often do anything to protect the one they love, no matter how bad it gets. In my case, it meant keeping up the appearance that all was well–even though some of my family and friends could tell I wasn’t happy.

Yet, Goodell could have made up for all of that once Rice told him he’d hit Janay. Even though that admission eliminated any good-faith interpretation of the originally-released video showing Rice dragging Janay out of the elevator, Goodell didn’t have the basic curiosity to question Janay’s story. The only explanation I can think of that doesn’t stray into conspiracy-theory territory is that Goodell was being deferential to prosecutors’ decision to put Rice in a pretrial intervention program rather than put him on trial. Remember, pretrial intervention was put on the table when Janay wasn’t willing to testify against Rice. Indeed, Goodell initially based the original suspension in part due to this decision by prosecutors. In deferring to that decision however, Goodell ignored the larger question of whether a player who hits a woman should get significant discipline.













All of this considered, the initial decision to suspend Rice for two games looks even more outrageous than it already did. Any commissioner who thinks handing a lengthy suspension to a player who hits a woman would somehow amount to slandering the victim’s character has no business running a major sports league. And any commissioner who hears a player admit to hitting a woman and doesn’t know it calls for a lengthy suspension has no business running a major sports league. Both together? I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again–Goodell has to go.

One of my friend shared this with me this morning and it seriously made my day. This video is of a Mexican-American Mariachi band singing our National Anthem. My friend’s comment was the best:

“One of the greatest renditions of my national anthem…AND by my favorite, a mariachi w/great voice. Makes me proud of the USA and my Mexican heritage.”

I’ll bet this pissed off a lot of redneck American sports fans. This is what patriotism looks like. I can’t stop watching it/listening to it. Beautiful. Watch below."

The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)?is a corporate handout disguised as a trade deal. It gives multi-national corporations unprecedented rights and is being negotiated in secret.

There is no doubt about it. The Trans Pacific Partnership [TPP] is one of the largest trade deals in human history. The key elements of this legislation is that it’s still under negotiation and that its controversial and is being meet by a surprising element in Washington D.C. these days bi-partisan opposition from both Republicans and Democrats.

The TPP is ostensibly intended to be a “high-standard” agreement aimed at emerging trade issues in the 21st century.[11]?These ongoing negotiations have drawn criticism and protest from the public, advocacy groups, and elected officials, in part due to the secrecy of the negotiations, the expansive scope of the agreement, and controversial clauses in drafts leaked to the public. (Source Wikipedia)

However, you can rest assure that there are well-funded groups at all levels advocating this trade deal by so-called fast track legislation that began back in the Nixon days. But, in response to this fast track legislation just recently a letter was sent to President Obama by 151 House Democrats to end this controversial Nixon-era procedure. Fast-Track,?is a procedure that?railroads contentious trade pacts through Congress. Many progressive pundits have gone as far to blame the President as being a sell-out on this issue.

Obama has asked Congress to delegate to him its constitutional trade authority via Fast Track for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and other pacts.

Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch said:

These letters make clear that Fast Track is history. When Nixon cooked up this scheme 40 years ago, trade pacts covered only tariffs. Now, deals like the TPP could rewrite wide swaths of U.S. policy, currently under the control of Congress, from food safety and financial regulation to Buy American procurement to energy policy.

Effectively, this trade deal (TPP) could change how all of us interact with the global economy. You might think that President Obama would want to keep us all informed on this issue with his transparency pledge and there being swirling doubt coming from the Affordable Care Act disastrous roll out and people losing their health insurance no matter how much a junk policy it might ?be the Presidents honesty has been put to question.

The fact is these negotiations have been done almost entirely in secret. With Obamacare and the government shutdown the main focus of the main-stream media, this huge, major trade deal, which sets new rules and regulations, or lack thereof on some 12 nations from the Pacific realm, has gone largely unnoticed.

What fast track legislation means is the President is asking Congress to relinquish powers given to Congress by the Constitution to the Executive Branch. ?Fast Track lets the Executive Branch unilaterally select trade partners, set agreements? terms, and sign them before Congress even voted. Then the Executive Branch could write implementing legislation, skirting committee review and amendment.

Whats really disappointing is most of what we know about the TPP have come from leaks. What these leaks are revealing is that the TPP is a ?huge give away to large trans-national corporations. In short, this deal would allow these corporations to sue the governments of these 12 nations for the regulations thrust upon them. Moreover,?This legislation could be directly submitted for votes, with congressional leaders? control of House and Senate floor schedules overridden. Votes could be forced within 60 days in the House and an additional 30 days in the Senate. Normal voting rules were waved, with all amendments banned and only 20 hours of debate. Unlike all past trade authorities, which covered only tariffs, Fast Track allowed the executive branch to ?diplomatically legislate,? using trade agreements to set policy on non-trade matters.

Opponents of the Trans Pacific Partnership have argued that the TPP would sacrifice national sovereignty, public health, and internet freedoms all in the name of keeping corporations fat and their share holders happy. This is why experts call the TPP, “NAFTA on steroids.”

The Trans Pacific Partnership

Sends Jobs Overseas

Guts Regulations

And Limits the powers of nations to fight back against these rouge corporations.

?The TPP ?puts the rights of profit driven business over that of humans and the government restrictions we put in place to protect ourselves from these ?” Corporations Gone Wild.”

There is a modern times phenomenon that has developed ?around this issue. Bi-Partisanship!

Polls show that opposition to more-of-the same trade deals is one of the few issues that unite Americans across party lines,? said Wallach. ?It’s not really surprising that there is bipartisan congressional opposition to Fast Track.? ?(?Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch)

So, we know there is bi-partisan opposition to this trade deal and more importantly to the implementation of a Nixon-era procedure called Fast Track. ?But, there is a deeper issue going on here. Just, the implication that something been going on behind ” closed doors’ is enough to arouse a growing discourse with WE THE PEOPLE ?not just of government but the principles within that government due to the overwhelming evidence of the rampant corruption in all facets of our society today.

The late U.S. Rep. Robert Matsui (D-Calif.), who led the Democratic House effort to pass NAFTA, described why Fast Track was unacceptable:

?Trade is no longer primarily about tariffs and?quotas. It’s about changing domestic laws. The constitutional authority to make law is at the heart of our role as a Congress and of our sovereignty as a nation. When international trade negotiators sit down to hammer out agreements, they are talking about harmonizing ?non-tariff barriers to trade? that may include everything from antitrust laws to food safety. I believe the President and the USTR should be able to negotiate trade deals as efficiently as possible ? But that does not mean that Congress must concede to the Executive Branch its constitutional authority over foreign commerce and domestic law without adequate assurances that Congress will be an active participant in the process. Congress should be a partner, not a mere spectator or occasional consultant to the process. ? Think about what may be bargained away at the negotiating table: our own domestic environmental protections … food safety laws … competition policies. That’s the air we breathe, the food our children eat, and the way Americans do business? The nature of trade has changed, and Fast Track authority must change with it. I ardently believe in the principles of free trade. But I will not put my constitutional authority over domestic law and my responsibility to my own constituents on a fast track to the executive branch.? — (Rep. Robert Matsui (D-Calif.), Congressional Record, 147, 12/6/01, at H9025.

The deeper issue is that there are over 600 well-funded well represented corporations who want to circumvent these above mentioned sentiments. The TPP is the holy grail of the 1 percent. The arrangement has been negotiated behind close doors for two years now. But, for the 99 percent this is a losing proposition.

Millions more American Jobs Offshored.

Backdoor deregulation deals for financial firms.

Floods of unsafe foods and produce.

Higher Medicine Prices

It would Ban Buy American Policies

Foreign corporations empowered to attack our environmental and health policies in foreign tribunals.

There is just a tremendous amount at stake here. So, who are the bad guys here. There are several but the short list is the infamous Koch Bros. Are you surprised? You might be since they are paying for a little known proxy called ALEC to do most its bidding for them and other elites around the world. So, what is ALEC?

Alec Explained!

The Koch Brothers have for sometime been trying to destroy social security. The have funded and backed several conservative think tanks and focus groups like the Cato Institute, Heritage Foundation, Reason Foundation and the Father God of all right-wing think tanks the John Birch Society. ?They know it’s a very successful program and they want to get their hands on the money by privatizing Social Security. So, they pay these organizations to spread misinformation and out-and-out lies about Social Security. Koch has funded over 300 position papers to dismantle social security. They do this by distorting the truth.

Need To Raise the Retirement Age to 70 years old.?They do this biding through campaign contributions to politicians and right-wing media outlets. Which creates an echo chamber. Social Security is going Bankrupt.?The Koch brothers have funded study after the study that suggest Social Security is going bankrupt. When in fact it is not going bankrupt in ?the least. We Should Privatize Social Security.?They would like to see everyone risk their Social Security in the stock market for example. Once again its all about creating an echo chamber.

How do they achieve this echo chamber? By position papers, pundits, media and politicians.

It has been the Koch brothers plan to dismember government in general. So, by influencing trade agreements and funding misinformation about Social Security and other Progressive initiatives they go about achieving these means by creating an echo chambers of lies and distortions.

?

Are you looking for a Teabully group that isn’t controlled by corporate interests?? Then the TeaParty.org just might be the one for you. Apparently uncorrupted by Koch Industries cash, this group claims to be a true blue, real grassroots movement built by?ordinary Americans.? Let’s look at the people running this group, and the group itself, through material taken directly from their webpages, available to anyone interested in spending a little time on the internet.

Go to the ?About Us? link?and you will see this:

The Tea Party includes those who possess a strong belief in the Judeo-Christian values embedded in our great founding documents.

This statement ignores the facts of history while also ignoring the legal fact that the only document that founded the United States is the Constitution and the words ?Judeo? and ?Christian?? appear nowhere in the Constitution.

Read and you will see the claim that:

Yes, we are a Christian nation.? However, you don’t have to be a Christian to enjoy freedom.

What appears to be a welcoming statement really isn’t when you consider the strict uncompromising doctrine making up the group’s ?15 Non-negotiable Core Beliefs? , which include:

Illegal aliens are here illegally. A strong military is essential. Gun ownership is sacred. Reducing personal income taxes is a must. Reducing business income taxes is mandatory. English as our core language is required. Traditional family values are encouraged.

None of these ??core beliefs? have roots in the Constitution or in any of the other documents said to be the ?great founding documents? of the United States.? And they look curiously like core beliefs more characteristic of fascism, as described over the weekend in the ?Primer For The Tea Party,? available on LiberalAmerica.org.

The TeaParty.org is believed to be the smallest of the Teabully groups but it might just be the most militant?and hardline.? An early leader of the group has been quoted as saying:

We don’t step on toes, we step on necks!

While the TeaParty.org website claims that it was founded in 2004, investigative reporting shows that the group was founded in February, 2009,?as the 1776 Tea Party, by Dale Robertson. What did get founded in 2004 was the Minuteman Project,?a group of armed individuals interested in preventing undocumented Hispanics from crossing the border into the United States.

The connection between the 1776 Tea Party, and what it became, TeaParty.org, and the Minuteman Project, is through Steven Eichler, current CEO, of the TeaParty.org.? Mr. Eichler has a long history of involvement with the Minuteman Project in Arizona. The?Minuteman Project has run into trouble even with noted right winger and longtime Maricopa County Arizona Sheriff, Joe Arpaio.?And, Eichler was named ?patriot of the year? by his former boss at the Minuteman Project, Jim Gilchrist.

Now back to Dale Robertson, who claims to be the founder of the Tea Party movement.?In February 2009, Mr. Robertson appeared at a Tea Party rally in Houston Texas, carrying a sign containing a misspelling of the ?N? word.??Robertson later gave an interview to the Washington Times claiming that he had never seen any displays of racism?at a Tea Party event.? Robertson is not now affiliated with the TeaParty.org.

Go to TeaParty.org and you will see that Dr. Jerome Corsi is the top researcher for the organization.? Who is this man?? He is the author of ?Unfit For Command?,?a book that was associated with the ?Swift Boat? campaign launched against then Senator John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic candidate for President.? And Dr. Corsi’s book, ?Where’s The Birth Certificate?,?might still be available for purchase.

Dr. Corsi is the founder of the 1776 Nation and he is a regular contributor to World Net Daily where his patriotic, Christian, and Libertarian views are mixed together.? You can read all about Dr. Corsi’s claim that President Obama is gay?on the World Net Daily. Dr. Corsi, who claims to have a PHD in Political Science from Harvard University, also peddles his financial planning services, through his connection with the World Net Daily, on Jerome Corsi’s Red Alert.

The founder and editor of the World Net daily is Joseph Farah who also has a long history in far right wing causes, apparently specializing in making claims against Democrats which are often as false as they are provocative. This pattern goes back to inception of the publication.? A lawsuit for libel filed on behalf of Democratic candidate for President, Al Gore, back in 2001, for the treatment he received from WND during the 2000 Presidential campaign reportedly was settled in 2008.?It has been said that the:

Terry Krepel, on Huff Post Media, writes that:

Joseph Farah has been using his weekly column to push lie after lie?about President Obama and his administration.

The Southern Poverty Law Center has published a detailed history of Mr. Farah and the WND and their entanglement in anti-government, patriotic, homophobic, Christian right causes and positions. The SPLC describes some of the assertions appearing on the WND as jaw dropping.

Now there are people who agree with the views that are presented to America by Dale Robertson, Steven Eichler, Jim Gilchrist, Jerome Corsi, and Jospeh Farah, working together over time and presented to us by the 1776 Tea Party followed by the TeaParty.org.? And, it is very possible, for those people to also agree with the views expressed by the TeaParty.org, and by the Minuteman Project, and at 1776nation.com, and on the page of WorldNet Daily.

There are other Americans who think that the views of these people, organizations, and publications are far out on the fringe right of society, not representative of the view of the vast majority of Americans.? After consulting with the FREE DOWNLOADABLE LiberalAmerica.org ?Primer For The Tea Party?, most Americans might also conclude that the TeaParty.org is not a grassroots American movement at all, but more a relic of the past which is being swept into the dust bin of history.

Maine’s Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Mike Michaud, came out as gay Monday via a Portland Press Herald op-ed. The piece’s tone emphasized his pride in all facets of his identity, particularly his working class roots. Asking why his sexuality should impact his ability to lead, Michaud still expressed his hope that:

If seeing someone from my background, in my position openly acknowledge the fact that he’s gay makes it a little bit easier for future generations to live their lives openly and without fear, all the better.

The candidate then shifted the dialogue to focus on his desire to get the state of Maine “back on track.”

Historically, Michaud could be the nation’s first openly gay governor, or one of two as he joins Maryland Democrat Heather Mizeur as the only two openly gay gubernatorial candidates. The announcement also drew media attention away from Michaud’s main opponent, Republican Gov. Paul LePage, on the day before his planned Tuesday campaign launch.

The race remains competitive, with the latest polls showing Michaud with a 3-point lead over LePage, who has a 6-point lead over Independent Eliot Cutler. Some, including Director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, Larry Sabato, believe coming out will win Michaud the votes of progressive college students who currently support Cutler.

Rep. Michaud currently represents the relatively conservative 2nd Congressional District, where last year 67 percent of voters cast their ballots for the Democrat, but 62 percent voted to reject Question 1, the citizen’s ballot measure that makes Maine the first state to pass same-sex marriage at the ballot box. The measure also attracted over $4 million in funding, about?four times the amount opponents raised. This may indicate a competitive funding edge to be gained from gay rights groups, despite Michaud’s desire to keep the issue away from the forefront of his campaign.

Of all the crazy and asinine things I have ever seen in my life, this morning’s so-called ‘report’ on Good Morning America is the end of the end. They did a segment with a wannabe warrior man giving advice on how to survive office shootings. REALLY?! Apparently, workplace violence training is becoming a ‘thing.’

They recommend that when you are cornered you get aggressive and attack with anything you have – scissors, a letter opener – anything. Hurt the attacker with the gun by stabbing him or her in the face with a letter opener. Yep – you’ll live through that – NOT!

Here’s the deal – you want to survive office shootings? Don’t work in an office. Stay huddled in your damn house, afraid of your shadow because at any moment anyone in your outer-net can snap and shoot you dead. They can get their guns at Walmart and just get pissed at you because you spent too much time in the bathroom and shoot you dead. If you don’t get shot at work, you’ll get shot by your neighbor because you asked him not to mow the grass at 7:00 a.m.

Maybe you just spend too much time at the watercooler and your co-worker feels slighted because they had to answer the phone at your desk when your wife called for the 50th time to make sure you were at work. Maybe you teased the co-worker about a new hairstyle, or an ugly Christmas sweater.

The fact is, you can be involved in a weapons incident at work, at the mall, at the movie theater, picking your children up from elementary school, on the freeway stuck in rush hour traffic, at the supermarket picking up those last minute dinner rolls your wife forgot for your boss’ dinner party.

It doesn’t matter where you are or what you are doing. Any small perceived slight can cause someone to snap. Should you have to undergo office training akin to fire drills to learn how to protect yourself from crazy-ass mother fuckers with no regard for human life? Should you have to live your life in fear of the person at the next desk because you never know when they’re going to snap and become the next angry idiot with a gun and no common sense?

The short answer is NO. You should not. Our government – those people that were elected to be YOUR voice in Washington DC need to do their damn jobs. It is time for us, as citizens and voters, to hold them accountable for the mess they have created with their marriage to the NRA. It is an unholy union and it should be illegal. We need responsible gun regulations in this country and they need to be enforced. NOW.

The people that are supposed to represent you are being PAID big bucks to ignore your needs and desires and swing their vote to support the gun lobby so they can sell more guns to you. Their entire purpose is to keep you living in fear so you feel like you NEED that gun to protect yourself from your co-workers. YOU need to call them, email them, make their lives miserable until they start doing the job that you sent them to DC to do. And when the next election comes along you need to vote them out of office. Kick them to the curb. For a handy list of people and organizations the NRA hates – the NRA produces this handy list for you.

We need a revolution and we don’t need guns to get it done – we need an informed electorate that is passionate enough to GO VOTE. You have a voice and you have failed to use it. In this Democratic country, your elected officials (the people that make your laws) are being selected for you by a minority of uninformed voters that get up on election day and go to the polls, with their open-carry AR-15 slung across their shoulder and their trusty sidearm at their hip in a locking holster that they probably can’t get the gun out of anyway.

They select the person they see most on TV, regardless of their qualifications or who is paying them. That small 20-40 percent of people have been selecting your government while 60-80 percent of you stay home on voting day and say your vote doesn’t matter.

IT WOULD IF YOU USED IT DUMBASS!

HELLOOOO. In case you flunked math – 60-80 percent is BIGGER than 20-40 percent. The MAJORITY of people in this country (the ones staying home on election day) could very easily retake our government within two election cycles. Just go vote.









Four years – in four years you can make a difference – but you need to start today. When you step forward, these idiots that are in Congressional office voting and taking money for the corporations and the gun lobby will tuck their tails between their butt cheeks and run, scared. They will run away from an informed electorate that has had enough, probably peeing their pants as they scurry away.

This week is National Chemistry Week and in honor of our beloved Chem nerds, here are 25 weird chemistry facts you probably didn’t know.

Today is Mole Day. Every year on October 23 from 6:02am to 6:02pm, chemistry students and chemists celebrate Mole Day in honor of Avogadro’s number, the number of carbon atoms in 12grams of carbon.

There is about 1/2lb or 250g of table salt (NaCl) in the body of an average adult human.

Lightning strikes produce ozone (O3) and help strengthen the ozone layer.

Humans have been using chemistry since at least Ancient Egypt. By 1000 bce human civilizations were using advanced forms of chemistry like extracting metals from ore, fermenting alcohol, and refining plant extracts as medicine.

DNA is flame retardant.

One bucketful of water contains more atoms than the Atlantic Ocean does bucketfuls of water.

If you slowly pour a handful of salt into a completely full glass of water, it will not overflow. In fact, the water level will go down.

Although oxygen gas is colorless (light refraction aside), both the liquid and solid forms are blue.

One inch of rain is equal to 10 inches of snow.

You have chemoreceptors (taste buds) on the inside of your cheeks too.

Hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will dissolve glass. Although it is corrosive, hydrofluoric acid is considered to be a ‘weak acid’.

Approximately 20% of the oxygen in the atmosphere was produced by the Amazonian rainforests.

The only elements that are liquid at room temperature are bromine and mercury.

Though solid at room temperature, gallium will liquefy in your hand.

Hydrogen is the most abundant element. About 75% of the elemental mass of the universe is hydrogen.

The most common isotope of hydrogen is protium, with is 1 proton and 0 neutrons.

The hardest chemical in your body is your tooth enamel.

The ethylene gas produced by ripening fruit, ripens other fruit and vegetables.

The only letter that doesn’t appear on the Periodic Table of Elements is J.

The human body contains enough carbon to produce graphite for about 9,000 pencils.

If you expose a glass of water to space, it will boil rather than freeze. The water vapor would almost immediately crystallize into ice.

Oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth’s crust, water, and atmosphere.

Bee stings are acidic while wasp stings are alkaline.

Mosquitoes like the scent of estrogen, thus women get bitten more often than men do.

The lighter was invented before the match.

And what list is complete without one silly joke? Billy was a chemist’s son but now he is no more, what he thought was H2O was H2SO4!

Barbie is slaying with the addition of seven new dolls joining the trademark line. Mattel is upping Barbie’s game and appeal with new body images, skin tones, and hair textures. Mattel has a global audience of impressionable girls who all deserve representation.

The makeovers will help more girls to see themselves as they engage in creative play. When girls (and boys) see their images represented positively in the world (even the world of play) their self-confidence increases.

Body Perception Impacts How Girls See Themselves

Curvy, petite, and tall body types are joining the Barbie family. Body image is important. In the U.S. girls as young as six are concerned about being fat. Different body shapes provide kids a choice from the standard Barbie of 1959–waif thin and anorexic. The original Barbie is still a big seller, but the new additions add variety and detract attention from unrealistic and unhealthy body goals.

Barbie And Doll Play Offers Teachable Moments For Adults

Adults can learn a lot by listening to conversations that take place during doll play. Imaginations are sparked when girls play with dolls. Adults can glean insight into how girls view the world. More important is that through play we can learn how girls view themselves. This offers an opportunity to foster self-esteem through encouragement and discussing negative self-speaking.

Clothing And Accessories Reflect Real Life Fashion Challenges

New changes means not all clothing will fit every doll. Some dolls have flat feet and the heels traditional Barbie wears won’t work. That’s okay, Flatfoot Barbie won’t need surgery later on from damage caused by a pair of cute to-die-for heels. Some skirts won’t fit over the dolls with curves, which makes the point that it’s okay for a girl can to both eat and live a little.

Girls Bond Over Barbie Playtime, Ken Is Uninvited

Time Magazine reports that Mattel ran test groups where girls and moms vetted the dolls. They found that younger girls are more concerned with bonding with each other than worrying about Ken. In fact one twelve-year-old girl was the sole participant to show interest in Ken.









Mattel and Barbie have a strong history with girls. By expanding Barbie’s body image, features, and keeping her affordable ($10+), girls dream bigger.

As many of you know, I am now a regular writer at Liberal America. When I first started writing for LA on the U.S., U.K., Europe, politics and differences subjects, I thought that it was kind of a limited scope. Now however, the more I write the more I realise how many things are so fundamentally different in the U.S. than in Europe or the U.K., not to say we do not have vast amounts in common, we obviously do, but there are some basic and intrinsic differences.

Children and Access to Violence and Nudity via Mainstream Media

One thing that has baffled me for a long time is the fact that in the U.S., attitudes to violence and nudity have somehow got turned around, the total reverse of Europe and most Western countries. In the U.K. for instance, violence on TV is limited. We have a group that monitors TV and anything violent is not legally allowed to be shown on TV before what is called ?the watershed?; this is either 9pm or 10pm depending on the level of violence. This includes every type of show from news, soaps, movies, everything.

While violence is not considered suitable for younger views at certain times, we are much more laid back about the human body. The human body in pretty much all of Europe/UK is considered natural and not something to be hidden away as if it’s somehow unclean, sordid or something to be shamed by.? I am not saying we have porn for toddlers as some on the right in the U.S. will be quick to visualise, but nudity, is seen as natural, a woman’s and man’s body is nothing to be ashamed of.? Programs may show breasts, or women/men semi naked without a thought and after the watershed, it’s OK to show most sex scenes from pretty much any movie. Post-watershed would mean that it would expect ages from 1+ to be watching.

Films here are also measured using a different rating system, much more based on violence rather than sexual content. We are not talking porn. Let’s get that out of the way. I am talking about openness, and about showing the human body which is considered normal. Violence is a subject we are much more aware of. One is seen as something natural and very much a normal part of being human, while the other — violence — is considered against the grain and something quite divorced in many ways from real life everyday life in a modern western country. Yes we know violence happens, but minus guns [see previous article on U.S. Gun Culture] it much less common and much less a part of everyday life here.

This article really is about attitudes to rather than access to, violence and nudity and how those attitudes relate to the right wing in America and how it is such an aberrant attitude in modern society, largely influenced by a vocal minority.

Societal Attitudes to Nudity and Violence and How They Differ between Europe and the U.S. ? How this is affected by the Right Wing in the U.S.

There seems to be an almost schizophrenic split in how the U.S. views violence as a society and how nudity is such a taboo subject. In the U.S. any magazine with any form of nudity on the cover is sold with an obscuring cover, I have seen them on shelves in many U.S. stores and it is utterly baffling. ?I am a great movie lover and I suppose the attitude really hit me or was more forcefully driven home, browsing movie reviews on sites such as IMDB. On every single movie with release in the U.S., there would/is always be a post about how much nudity, how much of a body is shown, are there sex scenes of any kind, is part of a breast shown or god forbid a nipple or male, female genitalia. These are perfectly serious questions posed and answered in depth. To Europe, this is so strange, why such a taboo? Why so many hang ups about what is after all perfectly normal and natural and given to U.S. by God or nature. This does appear to come from the Right Wing in the U.S., the Christian right who seem to view such nudity as outrageous, immoral and utterly wrong on every level. Why? Where did this attitude come from? How is it maintained and justified in a modern society?? No not from the puritan settlers, that was long ago diluted to nonexistence.? I know many Americans, both as friends and work colleagues, several are Evangelical, Born Again or Fundamental Christians and their attitude to nudity/sex is very repressed.

The real dichotomy is where violence enters the scene. Almost any amount of violence whether real on the news or portrayed in movies is seen as fine and utterly acceptable. If you look at almost all mainstream horror or gore-fest movies, they are made and largely consumed in the U.S. Many mainstream movies routinely show violence and torture as an act of revenge, which is seen as perfectly OK. Think of almost any well-known horror/gore fest and it’s made in the U.S., from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Saw series, Hostel series etc?Almost any level of violence which in Europe would be considered a fringe audience is normal and widespread in the U.S.

You hear time and again headlines from the right wing about how nudity and sex are corrupting the youth, how awful it is that such things are allowed. The real question is why is it seen as so terrible, but Americans seem inured to almost every and any level of violence, real or portrayed?



Throughout Western history, nudity and sex have always been seen as something normal, an everyday part of life. History books are full of examples from ancient Rome and Greece through medieval times, to modern times, sex and nudity, were always [ok we had the Victorians!] considered perfectly ordinary, which it is. In fact while in Europe, violence has become something seen as abnormal, something damaging to society. Capital punishment is a classic example, as are guns], the U.S. sees it as acceptable and normal.

The other paradox on this subject is that the U.S. is one of the world’s largest producers and distributors of pornography. This is of course a multibillion dollar business, so it must be ok to produce or sell hard-core porn. Even when made in countries such as Russia, it’s usually a U.S. based company selling it or offering it. Even if this was not such a big business in the U.S., is it not hypocritical of a country to be so absurdly prudish on one hand while on the other making vast amounts of money from hard-core porn?? What probably stands out even more is how often these right-wing advocates of morals and upright, anti-nudity probity are caught with prostitutes, with pornography or behaving in a totally immoral way. They then blame the devil or degenerates for leading them astray, absolving them of all personal responsibility. ?This is so hard for those outside the U.S. to understand!

It has no bearing on someone making a good leader or politician if he has affairs or is caught receiving oral sex. In Europe this really would not matter, many European politicians have been guilty of these indiscretions, but they carried on as normal except in cases when the behaviour was abnormal.

This double standard and refusal to even accept responsibility for their own actions is utterly and completely baffling to Europe and the wider issues of acceptance of violence within U.S. society, both real and portrayed, while rejecting nudity as beyond the pale, is to U.S., the normal values of society? totally reversed. But again, it is the minority who seem to force this onto mainstream America, but the questions still remain: how did such reversal of what is acceptable come about?

People in the U.S have a shorter life expectancy than many other countries, and a shorter one than any developed western country. What causes this? The lack of universal healthcare.

Yeah, we’ve come a long way with Obamacare, but until we have a single payer system, we won’t be what our Republican politicians like to say we are: the best country in the world with the best healthcare system in the world.

Oh, healthcare in the U.S. may indeed be the best — for the 1%. And for upper middle class. And possibly for middle class people who have solid insurance, whether through their employers or via an Obamacare exchange provider.

Here’s the lowdown. Click the map to view a full-size image.



Average life expectancy in years in the United States:?78.37 years

Countries who have a great life expectancy that we have are:

Monaco

Japan

Singapore

Australia

Hong Kong

Italy

Canada

France

U.K.

Jordan

Guam

Chile

And many, many more

Why is the U.S. life expectancy so much lower than other developed countries?

What do Liberal Americans think marks the primary difference between most of these higher-ranking nations and the U.S.? You get one guess — and you’ll all likely get it right.



Universal Health Care

There are certainly some exceptions. Russia, for example seems to be an anomaly, mostly due to the prevalence of smoking and an abnormal level of alcoholism in the country.



Why? And what can we do about it?

Why do you think the right wing is so blind to this obvious FACT??And yes, it is a FACT. My father, a doctor and a Republican, points out that many of these may be misrepresenting their statistics.?All we have to go on are statistics, however, so we’ll stick with that rather than opinion.

As for why the GOP refuses to acknowledge these facts, I’m sorry to say that my opinion is cynical and depressing. I firmly believe that they just don’t care. They know we die earlier, they SHOULD know that having universal healthcare will bump our life expectancy up, and they do not care.

The “worker bees” are younger, and the old retired bees don’t contribute as much financially to this country.

I’d hypothesize that most Republicans?may actually want us to have a lower life expectancy. It saves the government money. The less old people, the less money paid out in Social Security and Medicare.

See, I told you my opinion is depressing.

Here’s an argument for a strong publicly-funded school system: some right-wing idiots in Alberta, Canada decided to plan a “kudatah” against the current provincial government.

If you are not a phonetic reader, you may not realize that they meant “coup d’etat”– the French term meaning “violent overthrow of the government.” The stereotype that all Canadians speak French? Yeah, not so much.

The “NDP” mentioned by the nutjobs stands for “New Democratic Party,” a far-left party elected in Alberta after 44 years of Conservative rule. The NDP ran on a platform of restoring funding to an education system and healthcare system facing major cuts, and reviewing tax schemes and oil revenues. In American terms, Alberta went from having a Mike Huckabee government to a Bernie Sanders government in one election.

So, obviously, the Huckabee-philes are unhappy about a Democratic Socialist-leaning government, and have been complaining about it ever since their victory in May 2015. And since they have as much political savvy and intelligence as actual Huckabee supporters in the US, they have been promoting a non-democratic view. That idiocy has crystalized in this “kudatah” talk, roundly mocked on social media.

I couldn't resist, I want this tag to trend like a mofo. #ableg #kudatah pic.twitter.com/t6pXulz91X — Dave Sutherland (@Daveography) January 12, 2016

Some folks even helped plan a “kudatah:”

All you #ableg eggheads think you're clever mocking AB spelling. You won't be laughing when the #kudatah is a Feta Kamplee! — Keith Silva (@keithjs) January 12, 2016

Full disclosure: this is where I live, and believe me, I am embarrassed to be from the same province as these yokels. Alberta is kind of like Canada’s Texas– we have farms, oil, and lots of hicks. We also have urban centres that are as progressive and liberal as the rest of the country.









My city, Calgary, has the first visible-minority mayor in Canada, and the first Muslim mayor in North America. That’s right, folks: an openly Muslim mayor! And we haven’t adopted Sharia law yet! In fact, the city has become more liberal under Mayor Nenshi. And he’s such a cool dude that even the right-wing nutjobs haven’t planned a “kudatah” against him yet.

What if I told you that a right-wing radio host openly declared that “white power” was the only thing that keeps this country going? You’d probably wonder how he was still on the air. Well, what if I told you that host was a member of one of the most exclusive clubs in this country? Specifically, a black conservative who has bowed down to Donald Trump.









It’s been amply established that the standards to get into this club aren’t all that high. After all, consider some of its members. There’s Mark Burns, the South Carolina pastor who declared Democrats were the enemy during his benediction at the Republican National Convention, and tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton in blackface. And there’s former reality TV star Omarosa, who declared during the campaign that the country would have to bow down to Trump if he won. After Trump’s upset victory, Omarosa became a public engagement adviser to Trump, and used that role to warn a reporter that the White House had dossiers on its critics.

But black conservative pastor Jesse Lee Peterson may have outdone them all on the Wednesday edition of his radio show. During the show’s third hour, he openly declared that whites were the only ones who keep this country going. People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch got a clip.

Roughly seven minutes into the show’s third hour, Peterson and his producer, James Hake, engaged in what started out as a boilerplate case of a right-wing host offering fawning praise to Trump. Peterson said that while he had believed from the start that Trump was going to make America great again, even he was surprised by how “the light that’s within him” would “expose the darkness” in both this country and the world. Not entirely surprising, since Peterson considers Trump to be a shining example of how a real man should act.









He then praised Trump for shoving Montenegrin Prime Minister Dusko Markovic at last weekend’s NATO summit. Most of the world saw this as yet another example of boorish, bullying behavior from Trump. Not Peterson.

“He goes overseas, and as those weaklings try to get in front of him during a photo shoot, he pushed them out of the way. Obama would have stood behind in the back, and Trump went up and just grabbed the guy and pushed him out of the way. He got out in front.”

To Peterson’s mind, Trump was telling the world, “I’m the baddest man in town! A new sheriff is in town!” Hake was also pleased by it, and wanted to get the video.

But then Peterson crossed the line from mere alternative facting to something more sinister.

“White power! White power! I’m loving it. I love good. I love the light, I love it. And it doesn’t matter the color of the person that the light is coming from. I love it. I rejoice when I see men and women stand up with the love of God operating through them, overcoming evil.”

Wait a minute. In one breath, Peterson praises “white power,” then says that the color of your skin doesn’t matter if the light is shining through you?

Peterson then said that for much of Obama’s presidency, he believed that God had “given up on us” as a nation. He and Hake recalled how Hillary “sailed” through a Fox News interview in 2014. Both Peterson and Hake believed at the time that Hillary’s momentum was almost unstoppable. But Peterson claimed that one night while he was praying, God told him, “Be cool, Trump is coming. I will send my son and he will save you.”

Hake then recalled that there were a lot of white millennials, like himself, who were enamored with Trump and were “willing to fight” for him. Peterson agreed, saying that it was “beautiful” to see whites–especially young whites–“finally standing up” by suporting Trump. At that point, he really went off the deep end.

“It’s so refreshing, because if white people give up completely, it’s over for the country. It’s the whites who make things happen. Blacks and Mexicans don’t make things happen.”

Hake allowed that “very few” minorities actually do anything. Peterson agreed, allowing that “one or two” minorities at most actually make an impact. Nonetheless, the message was unmistakable–people of color really don’t do anything worth mentioning.

It turns out that this isn’t the first time Peterson has spewed something along these lines. A week after Trump took office, he dropped by Steve Malzberg’s show and claimed that only a white man like Trump could solve the rampant crime problem in areas like Chicago. Watch here.

Peterson said–with a straight face–that black men can’t “clean up their own neighborhoods” and “put their own families back together.” Only a white man can do it.

Granted, we’ve learned not to expect much from Peterson. This is a man who thinks blacks were better off before the civil rights movement, and also believes businesses should be able to discriminate with impunity. But with this latest screed, Peterson was blowing a dog whistle into a megaphone. If Malzberg, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, or any other white right-winger were to say something like this, they’d be canceled before the next break.

You may recall that earlier in the spring, after I blasted Peterson for his outrageous defense of Bill O’Reilly, Hake invited me to call into Peterson’s show. But I threw that offer back at him after his boss claimed that people who divorce are “selfish” if they remarry while their kids are still living with them. As someone who fled a marriage to an emotionally abusive woman, I considered it insulting on a personal level. It amounted to victim shaming.

As far as Hake was concerned, that made me a coward.

You want to argue behind a screen. I'm not wasting time on a closed minded coward. Call jesse or go away. — James Anton Hake (@JamesAntonHake) May 15, 2017

This is coming from a man whose boss engages in rhetoric that has no place in civilized discourse. Victim shaming, out-and-out racism, the lot. And said boss is only willing to respond in a forum that he controls. That says it all, from where I’m sitting.

Though he hasn’t yet been able to admit that he screwed up and typed the wrong thing when he sent out his midnight “covfefe” tweet, the vast majority of the world realizes that President Trump is a complete moron and isn’t capable of saying he made a mistake.









But now we have Trump supporters on Reddit claiming that “covfefe” is actually a secret anti-terror message Trump was sending to those in the know.

You may now shake your head and laugh uncontrollably.

Yes, Trump fans at Reddit’s /r/The_Donald site have been suggesting exactly what their savior was trying to convey, and they understand perfectly. Here’s some of the postings:

“Cov fe’fe means “I’ll stand up” translated from Arabic! The President God Emperor is giving us hope in troubled times!”

“Despite the negative media, I will stand up. Cov fe’fe means ‘I will stand up’ in Arabic. Trump never makes mistakes, you guys.”

“COVFEFE IS A MESSAGE IN ARABIC!”

Just to be perfectly clear, there is no word in Arabic that is even remotely similar to “covfefe,” not even if you break it up and spell it “cov fe’fe.” Apparently some of the simpletons who back the Donald got that idea from Google Translate.









But that didn’t deter the Trump faithful, who also had this to say about Trump’s inane Twitter babbling:

“26D chess!. He got everyone to cover the ‘covfefe scandal’ and once it is realized by the normies that he did actually mean something, they’ll be forced to cover that too! F*cking genius Trump!”

“So he wanted the media and the leftist retards to think he screwed up. He let them go on and on and on, while we just had a blast with it. That Magnificent Mad Man.”

Or perhaps you prefer this bit of incomprehension from another Trump acolyte: Trump is using Arabic to convert Muslims to his global cause to make America great again:

“He’s redpilling them in their own language!”

Personally, I prefer this explanation: Trump was sleepy, decided to send out a tweet, and then the drugs he takes kicked in and he drifted off. Because the thought that a man who can barely speak English learned Arabic (or learned ANYTHING) is simply beyond all belief.

So, Trumpkins, put that in your pipe and covfefe it.

While appearing on CNN Thursday morning to discuss President Trump’s plan to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, former Pennsylvania Senator and failed presidential candidate Rick Santorum proved why no one will ever take him seriously.









Santorum began by saying the president should use Twitter to promote his agenda instead of attacking the media, adding:

“If he wants to get on message then he needs to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord or maybe even a halfway measure.”

Former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm, who was also a guest, replied:

“No, no, no! There are 3.3 million people in America that are working in the clean energy industry. If you look at my state, there are almost 90,000 jobs in clean energy right now.”

To that very good factual point, Santorum responded:

“We have a fracking revolution. And it’s driving down the cost of our electricity.”

Yeah, a fracking revolution which is now causing increased seismic activity in places that have never before experienced such things. Not to mention the toxicity of the fluid used in fracking.









Again, Graholm used facts to make her case:

“Solar and wind are cheaper than coal. Right now, China is cancelling 107 of its coal plants because why? Solar and wind are cheaper than coal. Same in India.”

That’s when Santorum reached into his pocket and pulled out his stupid card, declaring:

“It’s not reliable, it’s not consistent.”

To that, Granholm could only exclaim:

“Oh my god!”

Here’s the truth, which Santorum neglects to understand or acknowledge: The sun is expected to last another 5 billion years. Life on earth will be around about another billion. That sounds pretty damn reliable and consistent to me.

"There are concerns that President Donald Trump is about to pull funding from Tibetans in exile for 2018. The worrying reports come at the same time that talks of a possible meeting between the Dalai Lama and Trump are also happening.









Sonam Dagpo, the Secretary for international relations has said:

“I am awaiting the official document as of now. There is a 24-hour time gap between here and Washington. Once it comes, then we will go through it. I have read reports but can’t react over that.”









The Shanghaiist also reported that the cuts would end a decade long policy to help Tibetans in exile – amounting to cutting millions of dollars. People have speculated that this could be because Trump is trying to win China’s favour. Lobsang Wangyal, a Tibetan exile suggested to the Times of India that Trump may think the move will ‘thaw’ relations with China. However about the proposed cuts he also said:

“The move is contrary to American ideals of freedom, equality, and justice. Time will tell if Trump’s policy is really in line with his ‘Make America Great Again’

While it is just a proposal at the moment, no one would be surprised if this administration really did cut Tibet’s funding to zero. They have after all voted to kick millions off healthcare by repealing Obamacare, as well as dropping meals for the elderly and poor school children. Compassion is something that the Dalai Lama and Trump clearly do not have in common.

The amazing thing about the Dalai Lama is that he is always happy and seemingly worry-free – not even the election of the inexperienced Donald Trump, to the most powerful role in the world, seemed to bother him in the slightest – not even the Pope is that holy.

Perhaps the Dalai Lama says it best with this Tweet:

Money and power attract friends. But it’s not you they’re friends with — just your money and power. Only affection brings genuine friends. — Dalai Lama (@DalaiLama) May 12, 2017

Nigel Farage is a person of interest into the FBI’s investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia.

Founder of the far-right United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and chief engineer of the disastrous Brexit vote, he was named earlier today. According to the Guardian:

“Sources with knowledge of the investigation said the former Ukip leader had raised the interest of FBI investigators because of his relationships with individuals connected to both the Trump campaign and Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder whom Farage visited in March.”

Farage has not as of yet been accused of any wrongdoing. The FBI label ‘person of interest’ only denotes that a given person might have information they are seeking. But with a UK election just days away, bitter divisions over Brexit look set to polarize even further.









Because Farage seems to be the focus of a lot of unwanted attention. Sources who spoke to the Guardian claimed that his connection to Trump first drew suspicion:

“One of the things the intelligence investigators have been looking at is points of contact and persons involved,” one source said. “If you triangulate Russia, WikiLeaks, Assange, and Trump associate the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage. He’s right in the middle of these relationships. He turns up over and over again. There’s a lot of attention being paid to him.”

The source also mentioned Farage’s links with Roger Stone, Trump’s long-time political adviser who has admitted being in contact with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker whom U.S. intelligence agencies believe to be a Kremlin agent.

Brexit Bro’s

Trump jumped into the Brexit debate back in March when he said:

“I think they (Britain) may leave the EU, yes, they’re having a lot of problems.”

Having correctly identified one of the possible outcomes of the referendum, he preceded to set out his reasoning in a typically robust way. He commented on the vote, insisted that he did not want to comment on the vote, then immediately commented on it again, saying:

“I think they may leave based on – I’m there a lot, I have a lot of investments in the UK and I will tell you that I think they may leave based on everything I’m hearing.”

Shortly after the results of the referendum came in Trump treated it as something of a personal victory.

They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2016

Time passed. Nobody called him that.

The Lies That Bind

His links to Farage are convoluted, to say the least.

Back in August 2016, Farage attended a Trump rally in Mississippi where he was introduced by Trump as:

“The man behind Brexit, and the man who led – brilliantly – the United Kingdom Independence Party, and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles.”

Farage’s message to the gathered faithful mirrored Trump’s own take on the political world; right-wing ambition fueled by populist anti-establishment rhetoric:

“We reached those people who’ve been let down by modern global corporatism. We reached those people who have never voted in their lives, but believed that by going out and voting for Brexit, they could take back control of their country, take back control of their borders, and get back their pride and self-respect.”

In October he was in St Louis, Missouri helping Trump prepare for a televised debate and was quick to defend Trump’s pussy grabbing comments. He refused to draw a distinction between male bravado and casual discussion of sexual assault opining that:

“Look, this is alpha male boasting. It’s the kind of thing, if we are being honest, that men do. They sit around and have a drink and they talk like this.”

It was Farage — and not British Prime Minster Theresa May — who was the first British politician to meet Donald Trump following his election victory. Which is hardly surprising considering how much the pair have in common. They both hold Russian President Vladimir Putin in the highest regard.

Indeed, in a 2014 interview Farage admitted that Putin was the man he admired most in the world.

Suspicious Minds

Despite having told assembled journalists he was only a “tourist” as he entered Trump Tower in November, he paid visits on at least two other occasions raising speculation that he had been given a new role advising on UK/US trade deals. Shortly after, Trump made it known that he would like to keep Farage close to his bosom.

Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016

The British government declined since it was, as The Guardian pointed out:

“Unprecedented for an incoming US president to ask a world leader to appoint an opposing party leader as ambassador, and the statement puts (Prime Minister) May in a difficult position.”

By January Farage had secured a lucrative deal with Fox News as a political commentator and was boasting that he was:

“Treated like a ‘rock star’ in the U.S.,” and that there was a “Huge temptation to up sticks and move to America.”









Conspiracy Theory

All of which sounds like one hell of a reward for simply agreeing with Trump on a number of key — yet ill-defined — policy matters. Still, at least it fits well within an easily observed pattern of behavior.

During the same week one-time French presidential hopeful and now soundly defeated fascist Marine Le Penn also paid a low-key, off the record visit to Trump Tower.

Far right French candidate Marine LePen is having coffee in Trump Tower right now. She wouldn’t say what she was doing there. h/t @srl pic.twitter.com/9YSC3e6Dl1 — Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) January 12, 2017

Le Penn declined to say whether she was there to see President-elect Donald Trump or not. The Trump team however, well aware of Le Penn’s financial dependence on Russian loans were quick to stamp out any rumors. They insisted that there would be:

“No meetings.”

Sean Spicer also jumped into the fray, re-tweeting a post by CNN’s Noah Gray.

.@seanspicer tells me Marine le Pen is NOT meeting w/ PEOTUS or anyone else from transition team. Adds “Trump Tower is open to the Public” — Noah Gray (@NoahGrayCNN) January 12, 2017

Still, unconfirmed reports suggested that the man to Ms. Le Pen’s right in the photo was Guido “George” Lombardi.

Lombardi has links to a number of right-wing European parties. He also works as an adviser for Mr. Trump. Not that Le Penn was the only far right Putin-linked fascist that team Trump courted.

As Liberal America reported last January:

“Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of Austria’s far-right FPÖ a party founded by former SS officers ( yes, actual honest to goodness, ethnic-cleansing, skulls-on-their-hats Nazis,) were treated as a welcome addition to Trump’s inner circle.”

What Lies Beneath

Of course, We have the denials.

Farage’s spokesman denied any contact with Russian officials, and described the Guardian’s questions about his activities as:

“Verging on the hysterical. Nigel has never been to Russia, let alone worked with their authorities.”

However, according to the Guardian:

“He did not respond to questions about whether Farage was aware of the FBI inquiry; had hired a lawyer in connection to the matter; or when Farage first met Trump.”

Furthermore:

“The spokesman also declined to comment on whether Farage had received compensation from the Russian state-backed media group RT for his media appearances. RT, which has featured Farage about three times over the last 18 months, also declined to comment, citing confidentiality.”

As has been noted, Russian president Vladimir Putin covets a weak and divided Europe. He has scored some victories over the past few years. Trump won the election. Unwitting dupe or active thrall he’s the guy sitting in the White House. The creation of a transatlantic alliance intent on turning the clock back to the 1930’s is real.

The alliance dreams of a world where people are hypnotized by the illusory magnificence of their own nationality. Of a world of Brexit where people sacrifice hard-won labor rights in exchange for watery promises of national purity. It is a world of Muslim bans, a place where people willingly give up rights in return for handfuls of placebos.

But mostly, it is a world of organized chaos, a world of nation-states and war. A world where the supra-national organizations capable of dealing with existential threats like climate change are dismantled and in their place, there is only the nation-state.

Warring, fractious, and above all, fascist.

Watch Farage gush over Trump’s magnificence.

It was a refrain Donald Trump used repeatedly during the 2016 campaign: If elected, he would “drain the swamp” and eliminate the old order in Washington where lobbyists and politicians scratch each others backs in exchange for money and favors.









But now, as president, it appears Trump has merely restocked the metaphorical swamp, and the new creatures that inhabit it also happen to be members of his administration.

Late Wednesday, President Trump granted ethics waivers to 17 of his top White House aides, including chief strategist Steve Bannon, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, along with four former lobbyists who are now members of the Trump team.

The pace of the ethics waivers is unprecedented. The 17 senior White House appointees have been granted ethics waivers in a mere four months time. In contrast, President Obama granted that same number of waivers to his top staff over the course of his eight years in office.

White House lawyers defended the waivers by saying they were justified because the administration’s “need for the covered employee’s services outweighs the concern” that the employees might put their own financial interests ahead of the interests of the country.









In the case of Conway, her waiver allows her to meet and communicate with former clients of her consulting firm, though the White House didn’t bother to explain how that was more important than Conway being able to make a buck while also receiving a salary paid for by taxpayers.

Bannon’s waiver will allow him to communicate with news organizations. Seeing as how Bannon is the former CEO of Breitbart News, this means Bannon can now coordinate strategy with right-wing websites and news networks as the administration continues their dissemination of propaganda to the masses.

White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the waivers keep “the president’s commitment to the American people to be transparent.” She added:

“The White House Counsel’s Office worked closely with all White House officials to avoid conflicts arising from their former places of employment or investment holdings. To the furthest extent possible, counsel worked with each staffer to recuse from conflicting conduct rather than being granted waivers, which has led to the limited number of waivers being issued.”

Drain the swamp? Trump is filling it to overflowing.

"A celebrity name has been put forward as a Democratic candidate for the Governor of Ohio. He has been a talk show host, more famous for entertainment, and yet far more politically experienced than the current president, Donald Trump.

Give up?









It is none other than Jerry Springer.

Yes, as in “Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!” That one.

Ted Strickland, former Governor of Ohio, told Business Insider that he had been speaking with Jerry Springer about the possibility. Strickland, who also ran for the senate last year, said he had:

“…Been doing whatever I could to encourage any of those who are talking about running … and I think it’s important that we win and that we have the strongest possible candidate.”

Expanding on why Springer would be a good choice, Strickland then added that Springer:

“…Certainly would start out with wide name.”

The world was stunned when reality TV star Trump, a man with no military or political experience, managed to pull off the fluke of the millennium by winning the presidency last year.









However, Jerry Springer does have actual political experience dating back to the 1970s. He has been the Mayor of Cincinnati, but he has also unsuccessfully attempted to be the Democratic nominee for the Governor of Ohio in 1982. He has also talked of running again in the early 2000s and again just a few years ago.

Springer has been a lawyer, a musician, and played an active role in his hometown of Cincinnati, even helping to save the Cincinnati Union Terminal. He is most famous for his sensational and over the top television show, The Jerry Springer Show. This program was hugely successful and made him a household name. It was the show that brought other people’s domestic disputes into America’s living rooms.

It seems he is still popular enough that Democrats such as Strickland are keen to use his well known status to ensure a win as Governor.

While all of this speculation goes on, Springer himself has thrown water on the idea as he recently tweeted this:

Article about me running for Ohio Gov? If I throw my hat in the ring, I'll let folks know. Right now, I don't even have a hat! — Jerry Springer (@jerryspringer) May 30, 2017

I guess we will have to wait and see.

Apparently all of our concern about members of the Trump campaign and administration are for nothing, according to conservative commentator Michael Reagan, who demonstrated his complete lack of comprehension on CNN Wednesday evening.









During an appearance on CNN Tonight, Reagan made reference to an unsubstantiated claim that the late Ted Kennedy used GOP Senator John Tunney to serve as an intermediary to the Soviet Union for the purpose of defeating President Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination in 1979.

Taken aback, host Don Lemon asked Reagan:

“What are you saying, in the interest of time? What’s the bottom line here? The bottom line is, this is not the first time Russia has tried or been involved in an election….This is not new stuff.”

In reply, Reagan asserted that none of us can possibly know what senior White House adviser Jared Kushner discussed with the Russian ambassador, and he then added this bizarre bit of deeply flawed logic:

“But guess what? Collusion is not breaking the law. Just like Kennedy — he didn’t break the law. It was a political move that he made, just like Jimmy Carter. It was political. It wasn’t breaking the law.”

Lemon:

“Collusion is not breaking the law?”









Pretending to be a lawyer, Reagan asked:

“What law did they break?”

That led the CNN host to say:

“Isn’t that treasonous to do that? I’m not an attorney, but it seems like that’s the whole reason for this investigation by the intelligence community.”

Reagan again repeated:

“Nobody can name the law.”

As for what law Kushner may have broken, Senator Al Franken, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was recently asked by Charlie Rose if what Kushner did was illegal. Franken replied

“I think it is. I mean, you’re supposed to — in getting his security clearance, you’re supposed to list those, and then there’s this peculiar one where he is trying to set up a thing within the Russian communications system so that our own intelligence couldn’t be part of it, which is very unusual. We’re going to be looking at this. You know, this might be — come out to,when, you know, what did the president know and when did his son-in-law tell him?”

President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget makes dramatic cuts to what little remains of the social safety net. If the budget is approved, many will suffer. But Native Americans will be among those hit hardest by the budget’s extreme austerity.









To really understand the abject cruelty of this budget, you have to understand that tribal communities are already living on the edge. Thanks to the systematic repression of native culture, Native American languages are all but extinct. Native youth are almost twice as likely as average American youth to commit suicide. And one in four Native Americans is living in poverty.

The Trump budget does nothing to improve these metrics. Some two million Native Americans receive health care and other services from the Bureau of Indian affairs, an agency within the Interior Department. But Trump’s budget proposal slashes Interior Department funding by 12 percent. That translates to cuts of:

• $64 million for Native American education

• $21 million for reservation law enforcement and safety

• $27 million for natural resources management programs run by tribes

• $23 million from human services

Money for law enforcement is especially important to ensure local safety. The Oglala Sioux tribe’s police budget, for instance, currently supports just 44 officers who are charged with covering a reservation that sprawls 3,468 square miles. That’s an area slightly less than the size of three Rhode Islands.









Tribal education would suffer under the White House budget. One of the deepest cuts to Native American budgets would be the elimination of $1.2 billion in grants for after-school and summer programs. Robert Brave Heart Sr., the executive vice president of Red Cloud Indian School on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, said the Trump administration’s plan would hurt his students. Other cuts to service programs like Americorps would make it more difficult for Indian schools to afford teachers and even bus drivers.

Native American communities would also be hurt by cuts to climate change programs. Trump has called climate change a hoax and installed avowed climate deniers to head many government agencies. But Native tribes, especially those in the Pacific Northwest, consider climate resiliency programs important. Carina Miller, a councilwoman with Oregon’s Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, explained:

“The reality is, is that’s how we lived. The indigenous way of thinking is you’re stewards of the land.”

Mason Big Crow, treasurer of the Oglala Sioux tribe, said his tribe stands to lose at least half of the money it currently receives from federal funds. According to Mel Sheldon, a councilman with the Tulalip Tribes in Washington state:

“This is the single largest attack on Indian Country that we’ve experienced in recent history. There is no doubt that the president has made a statement toward Indian County. It is not a good statement.”

Even the casual student of U.S. history knows that Native Americans have been cheated out of their land, lied to, and brutally massacred throughout much of American history. The Trump budget, if approved, will only perpetuate this mistreatment.

Business and tech mogul Elon Musk says that he’ll step away from the President’s advisory council if Donald Trump decides to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. Trump has yet to formally announce if he’ll withdraw or not, but the expectation is that he will. Press secretary Sean Spicer remained mum about the decision:

“I obviously don’t know whether he’s made it… When the President has a decision he will make that announcement and he will make it clear what the basis of that is.”

The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX made it abundantly clear on Twitter Wednesday that he’s done everything possible to encourage Trump to keep the United States in the treaty:









Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017

Asked via Twitter what he’ll do if Trump decides to leave, Musk responded that he would “have no choice but to depart [the] councils in that case.”









Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017

Musk is one of 18 business leaders who serve on Trump’s business advisory council, officially known as the Strategic and Policy Forum. He has also spent time at the White House with the president discussing manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and the need to spend money on the country’s infrastructure.

Musk is far from the only member of the business community to ask Trump not to withdraw. Despite Trump’s efforts to make it look like the corporate world is on his side, he has had a rocky relationship with many business leaders so far over the travel ban and now climate change. And they’re not afraid to express their distaste when they disagree with the president. Uber’s CEO quit the advisory council over the travel ban, and now one of the richest and most powerful men in the world threatens to leave as well.

So add that name to a long list of important individuals like Rex Tillerson, Trump’s own Secretary of State. Once again, President Snowflake only does what he wants, regardless of the consequences.

Many conservatives have actually said:

“I wouldn’t watch Rachel Maddow if you paid me.”

A new study in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology tested this very question.

The study told people that they would get a chance to win $10 if they read an opposing opinion on a topic. They would get a chance to win $7 if they chose the opinion that they already agreed with. The given topic was same-sex marriage.









A whopping 63-percent of the participants chose to stick with what they already agreed with, even though the amount offered was higher for reading the opposing point of view.

Jeremy Frimer, the University of Winnipeg psychologist who led the study, says:

“They don’t know what’s going on the other side, and they don’t want to know.”









Is Hearing An Opposing View As Bad As Getting A Tooth Pulled?

The study authors asked participants to rate hearing opposing viewpoints compared to other activities such as watching paint dry or having a tooth pulled.

The participants didn’t rate listening to an opposing opinion to be as bad as getting a tooth pulled, but it was close.

The study concluded that people:

“… Are motivated to avoid hearing from the other side for some of the same reasons: the anticipation of cognitive dissonance and the undermining of a fundamental need for a shared reality with other people.”

The studies also concluded:

“Together with a growing body of evidence suggesting that increased knowledge and expertise in a topic area exacerbates rather than ameliorates political bias, the prognosis for eradicating partisan bias with harder data and better education does not seem particularly rosy.”

We need to find an answer to make opposing viewpoints easier to consume. Facebook can help in this arena. We have to do more than just delete factually inaccurate posts. Maybe it will take more than $3 extra to get people to listen to opposing viewpoints. This is a battle against the tendencies of the human brain.

There’s been a great deal of outrage and whining from President Trump and his fellow Republicans over a photo Kathy Griffin appeared in which showed her holding the severed head of the president. Griffin later apologized for being a part of the photo shoot, but it has already cost her a shot at co-hosting CNN’s New Year’s Eve show with Anderson Cooper for the indefinite future.









But another employee of CNN, host Jake Tapper, weighed on the issue via Twitter, and while he condemned Griffin’s actions, he also reminded Trump and his GOP cohorts that they don’t exactly have clean hands when it comes to the issue:

Indecent behavior should be condemned — including not just faux presidential beheadings but, say, mocking the disabled or denigrating POWs — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 31, 2017

That’s right, Tapper did indeed put it right back in Trump’s face by reminding him of how he made fun of reporter Serge Kovaleski’s disability and said Senator John McCain wasn’t a war hero because he was captured and a POW at the infamous Hanoi Hilton.









Trump defenders on social media tried to make Tapper look like was complicit in the whole Kathy Griffin matter, but he was more than equal to their taunts:

I can rule out that anyone I spoke to or heard from in any way thought it was anything but disgusting and offensive — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 31, 2017

And then criticism from the left arrived from Rosie O’Donnell. Again, Tapper managed to keep his cool and make it clear he didn’t have time for divisiveness from either side of the political spectrum:

AND DO U DENOUNCE ALL THE RIGHT WING MORONS WHO SPEW HATRED AND LIES ON UR NETWORK DAILY JAKE – TALK AOUT DISGUSTING AND INAPPROPRIATE #USA — ROSIE (@Rosie) May 31, 2017

it his show – same with anderson – if its got ur name in the title – all that takes place on it is up to U – say no to the assholes – easy — ROSIE (@Rosie) May 31, 2017

OK: no. — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 31, 2017

Personally, while I disagree with the photos Griffin agreed to be a part of, I also see it as part of a larger karmic balance coming into play. Donald Trump constantly attacks people in petty, personal, and and offensive ways. If some of that comes back on him–say in the form of a special counsel named Robert Mueller who winds up exposing the president for the traitor he is–I certainly won’t shed a tear for the jerk who betrayed his own country.

After informing G7 leaders he will make a “final decision on the Paris accord next week,” President Donald Trump took exactly one day to conclude cutting domestic greenhouse gas emissions 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 is simply not worth it.









Denial is not a river in Egypt, but if it were, it would be rising at pace with its other aqueous counterparts due to man-made climate change.

So while President Trump is digging in his intransigent heels over a “Chinese hoax,” we need not look any further for climate change’s exigencies than our Alaskan brothers and sisters confronting effects of three record-breaking years of warmth following decades of rising temperatures, sea levels, and melting permafrost.

Residents of coastal Alaskan villages have for years watched the sea gradually devour their towns or cause their towns to sink as the permafrost beneath transforms from solid ice into swampland.

The epicenter is Newtok, an Alaska Native village in the Yukon River Delta. Residents have been trying to relocate for decades as permafrost erodes and the nearby Ninglick River eats away at its banks to the tune of 70 feet per year.

Romy Cadiente, the village relocation coordinator, told NPR in January:

“We just need to get out of there for the safety of the 450 people there.”

Newtok’s residents have started building a new village further inland, but they don’t have the $60 million to finish and relocate. Much of Newtok’s infrastructure will be inundated by 2020.

Sally Russell Cox is a community planner overseeing climate adaptation for the Alaska state government. She said:

“We have a plan for doing it, we know all the different components that have to be done and the sequencing for how it has to happen. If there was designated funding for Newtok they’d be done within two years — they’d be completely moved over.”

Alaska’s government is primarily reliant on oil revenue. Plunging prices and production have cast the state’s budget into disarray.

During the Obama administration, Cox was able to receive funds from various departments and agencies, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Commerce Department. The Department of Defense (DOD) sent soldiers-in-training to help begin constructing a new Newtok village. President Barack Obama proposed providing $400 million for Arctic village relocation. Due the Republican-led Congress during most of Obama’s tenure, though, that money never arrived.









A 2009 Government Accountability Office report found that at least twelve of the thirty-one most highly threatened villages hoped to move. Only Newtok has been able to find a suitable location, though.

Kivalina is one example. It is a village on a barrier island 500 miles north of Newtok, inside the Arctic circle. Kivalina residents found a new site to move to, but the Army Corps of Engineers deemed it unsafe.

Kivalina is expected to be underwater within a decade.

The federal government has only to relocate a single community threatened by climate change. In 2016, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded a community on Isle de Jean Charles, La. $50 million to move to safer ground. Alaska also applied but was denied. In January, before the Trump administration took over, Newtok asked the Obama administration for Federal Emergency Management Agency funding, but administration rejected the request, citing the community was not experiencing the type of disaster FEMA was meant to address.

And that’s with a president who took the existential threat of climate change seriously.

With Trump’s flat-out denial climate change even exists, Victoria Herrmann, president and managing director of the Arctic Institute, is not confident this administration will even bother listening to anyone. She said:

“There is no real reason to believe that infrastructure assistance for adaptation or relocation for Alaskan communities — or otherwise — will be made available under an administration that is skeptical of climate change and actively trying to backtrack on any progress made on greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation efforts.”

But Sally Russell Cox isn’t ready to give up on the Trump administration. She said:

“Maybe they’ll take a stance that they’re ok providing assistance to these communities because of erosion and flooding and permafrost degradation, but we don’t want to call it climate change. The impacts are not going to go away, whether you think its climate change or not. The impacts are going to continue to happen and they’re going to continue to need help.”

Trump’s stance against the Paris Climate accord and climate change appears less principled than financial, it seems. He recognizes climate change is a problem when it pertains to his business interests. A case in point is Trump’s battle with the European Union over building sea walls to protect his golf courses from rising sea levels.

According to the Washington Post:

“Trump has cited his tangle over the golf-course wall as Exhibit A in justifying a jaundiced view of the E.U. that puts him at odds with decades of bipartisan U.S. foreign policy.”

Isn’t it supposed to be all about us?

Former FBI Director James Comey may testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee as soon as next week, and what he has to say could well be the beginning of the end for President Donald Trump.









An unnamed source has told CNN that Comey will publicly testify that the president did, on numerous occasions, pressure him to end the FBI investigation into alleged collusion between Trump, his surrogates, and Russian agents during the 2016 election.

Comey has been in contact with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to determine the details of his testimony so that no legal barriers are crossed by what the former head of the FBI has to say which might hinder Mueller’s investigation.

The CNN report also goes on to explain:

“When he testifies, Comey is unlikely to be willing to discuss in any detail the FBI’s investigation into the charges of possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign — the centerpiece of the probe, this source said. But he appears eager to discuss his tense interactions with Trump before his firing, which have now spurred allegations that the president may have tried to obstruct the investigation. If it happens, Comey’s public testimony promises to be a dramatic chapter in the months-long controversy, and it will likely bring even more intense scrutiny to an investigation that Trump has repeatedly denounced as a ‘witch hunt.'”









Since he was fired by Trump in April, several accounts have come to light of Trump demanding that Comey pledge his personal “loyalty” if he wanted to remain as head of the FBI. At another meeting, the president allegedly asked Comey to end his investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, whom Trump reportedly referred to as “a good guy.”

Did the three instances when Trump allegedly told Comey to end the investigation constitute obstruction of justice, an impeachable offense? Legal experts have differing views on the matter, but if Comey does indeed confirm that the president wanted the Russia probe halted, it could potentially lead to some Republicans calling for articles of impeachment.

The source also had this to say about Comey’s upcoming appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee:

“The bottom line is he’s going to testify. He’s happy to testify, and he’s happy to cooperate.”

How do you stand up to the man?

There’s nothing special about what the Republican Party does. They represent a belief in a world where the strong should dominate the weak. Theirs is a bastardized view of Darwinian exceptionalism, one that has little time to consider its own logical fallacies. In their eyes, there is no bottleneck of wealth forced through a self-perpetuating loop of indifference and privilege.









They see only a level playing field of opportunity where life’s losers are the axle grease that enables them to run roughshod over everyone else.

It used to be a simple equation, an ‘and/or gate,’ where some of us voted left and others voted right. We won some, we lost some; Duverger’s Law kept the two-party system ticking over quite nicely.

But something went wrong. The right went sour. It festered in its own astringent juices vowing revenge for slight after imagined slight. It frothed at the mouth at aid programs, seethed at the thought of affordable health care, and choked on the bitter gristle of minimum wages.

Where once we saw advocacy of fiscal conservatism we saw in its stead an intolerance for anything else. Conservatism, once the Yin to liberalism’s Yang became a watchword for obstructionism. They pursued their own legislative agendas with feverish obsession, but when fate decreed that the Democrats run things for a while, they sat back on their haunches.

Arms folded, they waited for the pendulum to swing their way again. Waiting for the chance to erase anything and everything the Democrats had achieved regardless of its efficacy.

La Résistance

So how do you stand up to the man?

You take the fight to them.

That’s what David Yankovich is doing.









When Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan achieved his long cherished aim of repealing Obamacare he was in celebratory mood. And why not? He’d managed to push through a piece of legislation before the congressional budget office could score it. Congressmen freely admitted that they had voted for a bill that they had not read. That 24 million Americans might lose their health insurance as a consequence of their actions didn’t seem to faze them much.

It was all true to form.

It was all too much for one man.

David Yankovich is not a politician. He’s not rich. He’s not famous. But having just recently moved to Wisconsin, there’s one label that can be attributed to the man.

He’s part of the resistance.

It's official. I have filed the paperwork and I am taking on Paul Ryan. How badly do you want him gone?#WI01 https://t.co/HQUnxslX5w — David Yankovich (@DavidYankovich) May 30, 2017

How badly indeed?

Ryanectomy

His background is no different to that of many other ordinary working Americans. His father was a water treatment plant worker his mother, a property manager. He played sports at high school and chess with his grandfather; he was just like any other kid. Except that he learned the importance of social justice early on his life. At just 10 years old, he attended a campaign rally and met his new hero, then-First Lady Hillary Clinton.

Later, he worked as an intelligence analyst, but it was his writing for the Huffington Post and via his own site The Broken Road that brought him to the attention of those leading the fight back against GOP corruption.

A move to Wisconsin gave him the opportunity to do more than just regale against injustices.

Although the state’s 1st District is something of a Republican stronghold, the disastrous presidency of Donald Trump provided a unique opportunity. To stand against one of Trump’s great enablers. to rise up against Paul Ryan. To evict him from the halls of congress.

That would be oh, so sweet.

From Experience, Empathy

Weeks before launching his campaign, David’s mother was placed in a medical coma due to complication arising from undiagnosed COPD and pneumonia. Evan as Yankovich was informed that he might have to make a life or death decision, Ryan was working hard to take health care coverage away from more than 20 million Americans.

This single gif represents why I am seriously considering running.pic.twitter.com/u2Tknn2fbu — David Yankovich (@DavidYankovich) May 7, 2017

Idioms involving straw and camels barely do justice.

History will show that Paul Ryan failed to act in the best interests of the American people. It will reveal him as a self-serving crony whose only exceptional trait was an ability to divorce his ideological dick twitches from the suffering he caused. And sure, history will shame the man in the same way it has shamed other like-minded despots through the ages.

But for those who can’t wait, the prospect of David Yankovich wiping that smug smile of Ryan’s face must come as something of a consolation prize.

One too tempting for many of us to ignore.

Though he hasn’t yet been able to admit that he screwed up and typed the wrong thing when he sent out his midnight “covfefe” tweet, the vast majority of the world realizes that President Trump is a complete moron and isn’t capable of saying he made a mistake.









But now we have Trump supporters on Reddit claiming that “covfefe” is actually a secret anti-terror message Trump was sending to those in the know.

You may now shake your head and laugh uncontrollably.

Yes, Trump fans at Reddit’s /r/The_Donald site have been suggesting exactly what their savior was trying to convey, and they understand perfectly. Here’s some of the postings:

“Cov fe’fe means “I’ll stand up” translated from Arabic! The President God Emperor is giving us hope in troubled times!”

“Despite the negative media, I will stand up. Cov fe’fe means ‘I will stand up’ in Arabic. Trump never makes mistakes, you guys.”

“COVFEFE IS A MESSAGE IN ARABIC!”

Just to be perfectly clear, there is no word in Arabic that is even remotely similar to “covfefe,” not even if you break it up and spell it “cov fe’fe.” Apparently some of the simpletons who back the Donald got that idea from Google Translate.









But that didn’t deter the Trump faithful, who also had this to say about Trump’s inane Twitter babbling:

“26D chess!. He got everyone to cover the ‘covfefe scandal’ and once it is realized by the normies that he did actually mean something, they’ll be forced to cover that too! F*cking genius Trump!”

“So he wanted the media and the leftist retards to think he screwed up. He let them go on and on and on, while we just had a blast with it. That Magnificent Mad Man.”

Or perhaps you prefer this bit of incomprehension from another Trump acolyte: Trump is using Arabic to convert Muslims to his global cause to make America great again:

“He’s redpilling them in their own language!”

Personally, I prefer this explanation: Trump was sleepy, decided to send out a tweet, and then the drugs he takes kicked in and he drifted off. Because the thought that a man who can barely speak English learned Arabic (or learned ANYTHING) is simply beyond all belief.

So, Trumpkins, put that in your pipe and covfefe it.

Nigel Farage is a person of interest into the FBI’s investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia.

Founder of the far-right United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and chief engineer of the disastrous Brexit vote, he was named earlier today. According to the Guardian:

“Sources with knowledge of the investigation said the former Ukip leader had raised the interest of FBI investigators because of his relationships with individuals connected to both the Trump campaign and Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder whom Farage visited in March.”

Farage has not as of yet been accused of any wrongdoing. The FBI label ‘person of interest’ only denotes that a given person might have information they are seeking. But with a UK election just days away, bitter divisions over Brexit look set to polarize even further.









Because Farage seems to be the focus of a lot of unwanted attention. Sources who spoke to the Guardian claimed that his connection to Trump first drew suspicion:

“One of the things the intelligence investigators have been looking at is points of contact and persons involved,” one source said. “If you triangulate Russia, WikiLeaks, Assange, and Trump associate the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage. He’s right in the middle of these relationships. He turns up over and over again. There’s a lot of attention being paid to him.”

The source also mentioned Farage’s links with Roger Stone, Trump’s long-time political adviser who has admitted being in contact with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker whom U.S. intelligence agencies believe to be a Kremlin agent.

Brexit Bro’s

Trump jumped into the Brexit debate back in March when he said:

“I think they (Britain) may leave the EU, yes, they’re having a lot of problems.”

Having correctly identified one of the possible outcomes of the referendum, he preceded to set out his reasoning in a typically robust way. He commented on the vote, insisted that he did not want to comment on the vote, then immediately commented on it again, saying:

“I think they may leave based on – I’m there a lot, I have a lot of investments in the UK and I will tell you that I think they may leave based on everything I’m hearing.”

Shortly after the results of the referendum came in Trump treated it as something of a personal victory.

They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2016

Time passed. Nobody called him that.

The Lies That Bind

His links to Farage are convoluted, to say the least.

Back in August 2016, Farage attended a Trump rally in Mississippi where he was introduced by Trump as:

“The man behind Brexit, and the man who led – brilliantly – the United Kingdom Independence Party, and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles.”

Farage’s message to the gathered faithful mirrored Trump’s own take on the political world; right-wing ambition fueled by populist anti-establishment rhetoric:

“We reached those people who’ve been let down by modern global corporatism. We reached those people who have never voted in their lives, but believed that by going out and voting for Brexit, they could take back control of their country, take back control of their borders, and get back their pride and self-respect.”

In October he was in St Louis, Missouri helping Trump prepare for a televised debate and was quick to defend Trump’s pussy grabbing comments. He refused to draw a distinction between male bravado and casual discussion of sexual assault opining that:

“Look, this is alpha male boasting. It’s the kind of thing, if we are being honest, that men do. They sit around and have a drink and they talk like this.”

It was Farage — and not British Prime Minster Theresa May — who was the first British politician to meet Donald Trump following his election victory. Which is hardly surprising considering how much the pair have in common. They both hold Russian President Vladimir Putin in the highest regard.

Indeed, in a 2014 interview Farage admitted that Putin was the man he admired most in the world.

Suspicious Minds

Despite having told assembled journalists he was only a “tourist” as he entered Trump Tower in November, he paid visits on at least two other occasions raising speculation that he had been given a new role advising on UK/US trade deals. Shortly after, Trump made it known that he would like to keep Farage close to his bosom.

Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016

The British government declined since it was, as The Guardian pointed out:

“Unprecedented for an incoming US president to ask a world leader to appoint an opposing party leader as ambassador, and the statement puts (Prime Minister) May in a difficult position.”

By January Farage had secured a lucrative deal with Fox News as a political commentator and was boasting that he was:

“Treated like a ‘rock star’ in the U.S.,” and that there was a “Huge temptation to up sticks and move to America.”









Conspiracy Theory

All of which sounds like one hell of a reward for simply agreeing with Trump on a number of key — yet ill-defined — policy matters. Still, at least it fits well within an easily observed pattern of behavior.

During the same week one-time French presidential hopeful and now soundly defeated fascist Marine Le Penn also paid a low-key, off the record visit to Trump Tower.

Far right French candidate Marine LePen is having coffee in Trump Tower right now. She wouldn’t say what she was doing there. h/t @srl pic.twitter.com/9YSC3e6Dl1 — Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) January 12, 2017

Le Penn declined to say whether she was there to see President-elect Donald Trump or not. The Trump team however, well aware of Le Penn’s financial dependence on Russian loans were quick to stamp out any rumors. They insisted that there would be:

“No meetings.”

Sean Spicer also jumped into the fray, re-tweeting a post by CNN’s Noah Gray.

.@seanspicer tells me Marine le Pen is NOT meeting w/ PEOTUS or anyone else from transition team. Adds “Trump Tower is open to the Public” — Noah Gray (@NoahGrayCNN) January 12, 2017

Still, unconfirmed reports suggested that the man to Ms. Le Pen’s right in the photo was Guido “George” Lombardi.

Lombardi has links to a number of right-wing European parties. He also works as an adviser for Mr. Trump. Not that Le Penn was the only far right Putin-linked fascist that team Trump courted.

As Liberal America reported last January:

“Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of Austria’s far-right FPÖ a party founded by former SS officers ( yes, actual honest to goodness, ethnic-cleansing, skulls-on-their-hats Nazis,) were treated as a welcome addition to Trump’s inner circle.”

What Lies Beneath

Of course, We have the denials.

Farage’s spokesman denied any contact with Russian officials, and described the Guardian’s questions about his activities as:

“Verging on the hysterical. Nigel has never been to Russia, let alone worked with their authorities.”

However, according to the Guardian:

“He did not respond to questions about whether Farage was aware of the FBI inquiry; had hired a lawyer in connection to the matter; or when Farage first met Trump.”

Furthermore:

“The spokesman also declined to comment on whether Farage had received compensation from the Russian state-backed media group RT for his media appearances. RT, which has featured Farage about three times over the last 18 months, also declined to comment, citing confidentiality.”

As has been noted, Russian president Vladimir Putin covets a weak and divided Europe. He has scored some victories over the past few years. Trump won the election. Unwitting dupe or active thrall he’s the guy sitting in the White House. The creation of a transatlantic alliance intent on turning the clock back to the 1930’s is real.

The alliance dreams of a world where people are hypnotized by the illusory magnificence of their own nationality. Of a world of Brexit where people sacrifice hard-won labor rights in exchange for watery promises of national purity. It is a world of Muslim bans, a place where people willingly give up rights in return for handfuls of placebos.

But mostly, it is a world of organized chaos, a world of nation-states and war. A world where the supra-national organizations capable of dealing with existential threats like climate change are dismantled and in their place, there is only the nation-state.

Warring, fractious, and above all, fascist.

Watch Farage gush over Trump’s magnificence.

Apparently all of our concern about members of the Trump campaign and administration are for nothing, according to conservative commentator Michael Reagan, who demonstrated his complete lack of comprehension on CNN Wednesday evening.









During an appearance on CNN Tonight, Reagan made reference to an unsubstantiated claim that the late Ted Kennedy used GOP Senator John Tunney to serve as an intermediary to the Soviet Union for the purpose of defeating President Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination in 1979.

Taken aback, host Don Lemon asked Reagan:

“What are you saying, in the interest of time? What’s the bottom line here? The bottom line is, this is not the first time Russia has tried or been involved in an election….This is not new stuff.”

In reply, Reagan asserted that none of us can possibly know what senior White House adviser Jared Kushner discussed with the Russian ambassador, and he then added this bizarre bit of deeply flawed logic:

“But guess what? Collusion is not breaking the law. Just like Kennedy — he didn’t break the law. It was a political move that he made, just like Jimmy Carter. It was political. It wasn’t breaking the law.”

Lemon:

“Collusion is not breaking the law?”









Pretending to be a lawyer, Reagan asked:

“What law did they break?”

That led the CNN host to say:

“Isn’t that treasonous to do that? I’m not an attorney, but it seems like that’s the whole reason for this investigation by the intelligence community.”

Reagan again repeated:

“Nobody can name the law.”

As for what law Kushner may have broken, Senator Al Franken, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was recently asked by Charlie Rose if what Kushner did was illegal. Franken replied

“I think it is. I mean, you’re supposed to — in getting his security clearance, you’re supposed to list those, and then there’s this peculiar one where he is trying to set up a thing within the Russian communications system so that our own intelligence couldn’t be part of it, which is very unusual. We’re going to be looking at this. You know, this might be — come out to,when, you know, what did the president know and when did his son-in-law tell him?”

Business and tech mogul Elon Musk says that he’ll step away from the President’s advisory council if Donald Trump decides to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. Trump has yet to formally announce if he’ll withdraw or not, but the expectation is that he will. Press secretary Sean Spicer remained mum about the decision:

“I obviously don’t know whether he’s made it… When the President has a decision he will make that announcement and he will make it clear what the basis of that is.”

The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX made it abundantly clear on Twitter Wednesday that he’s done everything possible to encourage Trump to keep the United States in the treaty:









Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017

Asked via Twitter what he’ll do if Trump decides to leave, Musk responded that he would “have no choice but to depart [the] councils in that case.”









Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017

Musk is one of 18 business leaders who serve on Trump’s business advisory council, officially known as the Strategic and Policy Forum. He has also spent time at the White House with the president discussing manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and the need to spend money on the country’s infrastructure.

Musk is far from the only member of the business community to ask Trump not to withdraw. Despite Trump’s efforts to make it look like the corporate world is on his side, he has had a rocky relationship with many business leaders so far over the travel ban and now climate change. And they’re not afraid to express their distaste when they disagree with the president. Uber’s CEO quit the advisory council over the travel ban, and now one of the richest and most powerful men in the world threatens to leave as well.

So add that name to a long list of important individuals like Rex Tillerson, Trump’s own Secretary of State. Once again, President Snowflake only does what he wants, regardless of the consequences.

When talk of climate change and rising temperatures first came to light, some people argued that it was just a natural fluctuation in global temperatures.









As time went on, scientists began to gather more evidence of increasing global temperatures. They gathered information on how human activities are impacting the atmosphere. Slowly, but surely, the evidence rolled in until virtually every professional science organization in the world came to understand that climate change is real. And that human activities are a huge contributor.









But as we all know, even though the recognition of climate change goes all the way back to the mid 1880’s, there are still people who refuse to admit it’s real.

People like our current President, who once called the whole thing a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.

And people like Congressman Tim Walberg, Republican of Michigan. This elected official told his constituents last week then he does believe in climate change. He just isn’t sure that humans are responsible.

Then he said something so completely delusional that you have to wonder about his connection to reality. He said this:

“I believe there’s climate change. I believe there’s been climate change since the beginning of time. I believe there are cycles. Do I think man has some impact? Yeah, of course. Can man change the entire universe? No. Why do I believe that? Well, as a Christian, I believe that there is a creator in God who is much bigger than us. And I’m confident that, if there’s a real problem, he can take care of it.”

Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you read that correctly. This…person…says that the U.S. doesn’t need to worry about silly things like reducing our carbon emissions or switching to renewable energy. Heck, no! See, in his delusional little brain, God will take care of it!

Obviously, Congressman Walberg has either never heard of the African drought that has killed hundreds of thousands of humans. Either that or he thinks that God has a preference for white Americans and doesn’t mind all the horror that is hitting black African families.

This is the kind of thing that makes some of us wonder if humans are actually the most valuable species on this planet.

There’s been a great deal of outrage and whining from President Trump and his fellow Republicans over a photo Kathy Griffin appeared in which showed her holding the severed head of the president. Griffin later apologized for being a part of the photo shoot, but it has already cost her a shot at co-hosting CNN’s New Year’s Eve show with Anderson Cooper for the indefinite future.









But another employee of CNN, host Jake Tapper, weighed on the issue via Twitter, and while he condemned Griffin’s actions, he also reminded Trump and his GOP cohorts that they don’t exactly have clean hands when it comes to the issue:

Indecent behavior should be condemned — including not just faux presidential beheadings but, say, mocking the disabled or denigrating POWs — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 31, 2017

That’s right, Tapper did indeed put it right back in Trump’s face by reminding him of how he made fun of reporter Serge Kovaleski’s disability and said Senator John McCain wasn’t a war hero because he was captured and a POW at the infamous Hanoi Hilton.









Trump defenders on social media tried to make Tapper look like was complicit in the whole Kathy Griffin matter, but he was more than equal to their taunts:

I can rule out that anyone I spoke to or heard from in any way thought it was anything but disgusting and offensive — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 31, 2017

And then criticism from the left arrived from Rosie O’Donnell. Again, Tapper managed to keep his cool and make it clear he didn’t have time for divisiveness from either side of the political spectrum:

AND DO U DENOUNCE ALL THE RIGHT WING MORONS WHO SPEW HATRED AND LIES ON UR NETWORK DAILY JAKE – TALK AOUT DISGUSTING AND INAPPROPRIATE #USA — ROSIE (@Rosie) May 31, 2017

it his show – same with anderson – if its got ur name in the title – all that takes place on it is up to U – say no to the assholes – easy — ROSIE (@Rosie) May 31, 2017

OK: no. — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 31, 2017

Personally, while I disagree with the photos Griffin agreed to be a part of, I also see it as part of a larger karmic balance coming into play. Donald Trump constantly attacks people in petty, personal, and and offensive ways. If some of that comes back on him–say in the form of a special counsel named Robert Mueller who winds up exposing the president for the traitor he is–I certainly won’t shed a tear for the jerk who betrayed his own country.

Former FBI Director James Comey may testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee as soon as next week, and what he has to say could well be the beginning of the end for President Donald Trump.









An unnamed source has told CNN that Comey will publicly testify that the president did, on numerous occasions, pressure him to end the FBI investigation into alleged collusion between Trump, his surrogates, and Russian agents during the 2016 election.

Comey has been in contact with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to determine the details of his testimony so that no legal barriers are crossed by what the former head of the FBI has to say which might hinder Mueller’s investigation.

The CNN report also goes on to explain:

“When he testifies, Comey is unlikely to be willing to discuss in any detail the FBI’s investigation into the charges of possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign — the centerpiece of the probe, this source said. But he appears eager to discuss his tense interactions with Trump before his firing, which have now spurred allegations that the president may have tried to obstruct the investigation. If it happens, Comey’s public testimony promises to be a dramatic chapter in the months-long controversy, and it will likely bring even more intense scrutiny to an investigation that Trump has repeatedly denounced as a ‘witch hunt.'”









Since he was fired by Trump in April, several accounts have come to light of Trump demanding that Comey pledge his personal “loyalty” if he wanted to remain as head of the FBI. At another meeting, the president allegedly asked Comey to end his investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, whom Trump reportedly referred to as “a good guy.”

Did the three instances when Trump allegedly told Comey to end the investigation constitute obstruction of justice, an impeachable offense? Legal experts have differing views on the matter, but if Comey does indeed confirm that the president wanted the Russia probe halted, it could potentially lead to some Republicans calling for articles of impeachment.

The source also had this to say about Comey’s upcoming appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee:

“The bottom line is he’s going to testify. He’s happy to testify, and he’s happy to cooperate.”

Since coming back from his trip to the Middle East and Europe, President Trump has been tweeting at a frantic pace, and it all culminated with a bizarre tweet he sent out early Wednesday morning with a misspelled word:









He later deleted that tweet, but it, along with others he’s been posting since returning to the White House, is causing more than a bit of concern in Washington.

On CNN Wednesday morning, a panel concluded that Trump may be in the process of melting down mentally. Real Clear Politics editor A.B. Stoddard said the tweets prove the president feels isolated:

“He brings himself a world of hurt with these tweets. He is very self-destructive. The entire Comey firing showed it. He said it was because of the Rosenstein memo… He sent his spokesman out to say the same thing. He sent Vice President Mike Pence out to say the same thing. Then he told Lester Holt it was all about Russia…No one is able to stop him.”

Former Meet the Press host David Gregory noted that Trump’s recent tweets show:

“He is in the middle of the new round of ranting of press coverage and trying to distract from the investigation over Russia.”









Gregory then added that Trump’s social media postings often contradict statements from this White House press office, and that is eating away at what little credibility the administration may have left:

“What is unfortunate for Sean Spicer is the White House press secretary position under President Trump doesn’t have credibility. I’ve been in this job. I had interactions with press secretaries. I have a certain amount of sympathy for Sean Spicer. He has to do what his boss wants him to do. His boss is not truthful to the American people, nor are the people who work for President Trump.”

Let’s be brutally honest: This president is spiraling out of control and could get us into a war because of his mental instability and lack of self-control. He needs to be removed from office.

After once again solidifying his place in history as the most ignorant and unhinged person to ever be elected president, Donald Trump thought he’d add some icing to the honor by tweeting out his already infamous “covfefe” comment at six minutes after midnight:









About six hours later and having deleted the tweet, Trump decided he’d take a shot at being funny, which is clearly not something he’s any good at:

Who can figure out the true meaning of ""covfefe"" ??? Enjoy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2017

Result: In six hours time Trump got mocked twice for the same thing:

Upon returning to Washington Sunday, President Donald Trump declared his first foreign trip “a great success.” German chancellor Angela Merkel, however, seemed to disagree. Merkel, who is up for reelection in September, addressed a crowd of campaign supporters shortly after the end of the G7 summit.

“The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I’ve experienced that in the last few days.”

“We have to know that we must fight for our future on our own, for our destiny as Europeans.”

Merkel characterized the G7 talks as “six against one” and “very unsatisfactory.”









Her comments were at least partly the result of Trump blasting Germany, one of America’s closest allies, as “very, very bad” during his address to NATO leaders over the weekend.

“See the millions of cars they are selling to the U.S. Terrible. We will stop this.”

Trump apparently forgot (or, more likely, doesn’t know) that stateside German auto plants provide thousands of American jobs.

But Merkel was also surely troubled by Trump’s policy positions across a range of issues. While leaders from Italy, Germany, Canada, the U.K., Japan, and France affirmed their commitment to the historic Paris Agreement, Trump made no such promise. He later said he would issue a decision about the international climate deal sometime this week.









In his address to NATO, Trump also declined to reaffirm American commitment to Article 5, the mutual defense clause of the NATO charter. Under Article 5, an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all NATO countries. This principle has only been invoked once – when the U.S. was attacked on September 11, 2001.

Instead, Trump used his address to lambaste NATO countries for failing, in his view, to pay their fair share. In point of fact, NATO member states are not actually behind in their military spending.

Merkel was not the only German leader to conclude that the U.S. was no longer reliable. Germany’s foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said:

“Anyone who accelerates climate change by weakening environmental protection, who sells more weapons in conflict zones, and who does not want to politically resolve religious conflicts is putting peace in Europe at risk.”

What does all this mean in the grand scheme? Salon’s Heather Parton explored the impact of weakened U.S. leadership in a recent piece, writing:

“Trump’s election has resulted in a loss of trust that’s going to be almost impossible to get back. Many countries in this world depend upon the American security umbrella and a predictable American foreign policy, even if they aren’t particularly happy about it. They’re going to look for other arrangements now.”

In a Europe without either the U.K. or the U.S., Germany or France could take on a larger role. But Russia could see the dissolution of the Atlantic alliance as a green light to push its own agenda. No matter what happens, Trump’s “America first” policy has left Europe to fend for itself.

The news that the FBI is scrutinizing President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner is an intriguing new development in the Bureau’s Russia investigation. At issue is reports that Kushner reached out to Russian officials to create a clandestine direct line of communication with the Kremlin during the 2016 presidential campaign. Now, Kushner’s lawyers say that the FBI and other investigators don’t need to worry about their client avoiding them. In fact, they say that Kushner will talk to Congress and any federal investigators whenever called.









Even before this revelation, it makes sense that Kushner would at the very least need to talk with the investigators. Defense lawyer Edward MacMahon explains:

“The FBI tries to be thorough in their investigations… If it’s been publicly reported that he met with Russians, and the investigation has to do with administration officials meeting with Russians, well, then, they’ll probably want to talk to everybody.”

Yeah, duh. I’m a lawyer, but anyone could guess that.









The White House in March confirmed that Kushner and Michael Flynn, the ousted national security adviser, met with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States. The meeting took place at Trump Tower in December for what one official called a brief courtesy meeting. Lawyers for the Trump adviser made it abundantly clear in a statement released on Thursday that Kushner had nowhere to hide:

“Mr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings. He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.”

Of course the Trump administration is trying to emphasize that just because someone is under FBI investigation that doesn’t necessarily make them guilty. It also doesn’t take a lawyer to draw that conclusion, guys. What it does indicate is yet another person connected to Trump with shady contacts that they conveniently forgot to report. Another string is pulled. When will the whole thing unravel?

Watch a discussion of Kushner’s actions here:

Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) gave a speech in Australia on Tuesday. He said, in part:









“I realize that I come to Australia at a time when many are questioning whether America is still committed to these values. And you are not alone. Other American allies have similar doubts these days. And that is understandable.”

“I realize that some of President Trump’s actions and statements have unsettled America’s friends. They have unsettled many Americans as well.”

President Donald Trump’s relationship with Australia was questioned back in January when there were reports of an uncomfortable phone call between Trump and Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull.

McCain also said:

“And frankly, I do not know how this debate will play out. What I do believe, and I do not think I am exaggerating here, is that the future of the world will turn, to a large extent, on how this debate in America is resolved.”









He added:

“… This is why I have come to Australia, and why I want to speak with you tonight. But I also want you to know this: Just as America is counting on Australia, I believe that Australia, and our other allies and partners, can still count on America.”

“I know there is a belief that Americans have turned isolationist and protectionist. But recent public opinion polls consistently tell the opposite story. Most Americans say they still see globalisation as good for them. Most Americans say they still want to maintain a strong military. Most Americans say they still favor our existing alliances—89 percent in one major poll last year. Most Americans even say they want to maintain or increase those alliance commitments.”

“Put simply, my friends: I believe bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-alliances, pro-trade, pro-investment, pro-military, pro-globalisation, in favor of an internationalist foreign policy, and supportive of our alliance with Australia.”

Here is a news clip about the speech (after the jump):

Something very strange is going on with Donald Trump’s Twitter account, and it has nothing to do with the postings being made by the president.









Over the past few days, Trump has been adding followers at the rate of hundreds a minute, which is unusual even for the leader of the free world who likes to tweet out some of the most ridiculous stuff ever seen on social media. In the closing days of May, Trump has added some 5 million new followers.

But here’s the twist: The vast majority of the president’s new followers have no picture, no tweets, and no followers of their own.

A Twitter audit report perfectly illustrates why many social media insiders are suggesting that Trump has bought his new followers:

Yep, Twitter estimates that nearly 15 million of Trump’s followers are fake, which gives him an audit score of only 51 percent.

But here’s the larger mystery: Why is Trump suddenly adding several million new followers? Why would he be buying fakes for his account? Could it be an attempt to surpass President Obama’s 89.2 followers? If so, he’s still got one hell of a climb: He’s gonna need 59 million more to be in the same ballpark with Obama.









Here’s another possibility: Bots. Russian bots, perhaps? Could be, yes. That, or are we supposed to believe that 5 million people all created accounts and followed him on the exact same day? Kind of stretches credulity to even suggest that possibility.

One person on Twitter speculated:

“Did Donald Trump actually buy 3 million followers how insecure is he?”

As we all know, Trump possesses more than an adequate reserve of insecurity to make his purchasing millions of new fans very plausible.

Another social media resident had this to say:

“Unsurprisingly, over half of Donald Trump’s followers are fake. Bought, bots or both?”

None of Trump’s representatives are commenting at this point. But should he continue to add faceless followers at the same rate, an explanation may be necessary. Wonder what the White House would say if 5 million people stopped following the president on the same day. Something tells me they’d blame the New York Times or Washington Post.

How do you know that even the most devoted Trump defenders are running out of valid arguments to use as a defense of the blatantly indefensible actions of both the president and his advisers? When they agree to go on cable news and then have an on-air spasm of such massive ignorance that even the host is almost unable to contain her laughter.









Such was the case on CNN Tuesday morning when former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu was interviewed by Alisyn Camerota. The host asked Sununu what he thought about Jared Kushner meeting with a Russian banker and the Russian ambassador to set up a back-channel line of communication. To that, Sununu replied:

“I don’t think there is anything there. So you’re implying — you’re implying — because during the ten weeks [of the presidential transition] everybody is trying to meet the administration. Everybody who is involved in business. Everybody who is involved in politics. I can’t tell you how many people tried to meet with me between the time I was named chief of staff.”

Camerota’s follow-up question was the one that tripped up Sununu: Did you ever meet with the head of a Russian bank when you were chief of staff for George H.W. Bush? Sununu responded:

“No, but I had breakfast with the vice president at the Russian embassy, and a lot of folks there started talking to me!”









The ridiculous analogy made Camerota snicker. She then asked:

“Would you have carved out time to meet with a Russian banker with ties to Vladimir Putin if he asked?”

Sununu:

“I’m not even sure what would have happened. First of all, Putin wasn’t there. Look, you’re asking hypotheticals on hypotheticals.”

As she ended the interview, Camerota, who was visibly trying to hold back bursting out laughing, told Sununu:

“We appreciate your perspective that there is nothing to see here, and that the investigation is, I don’t know, silly.”

Yep, nothing to see here except several instances of potential treason and espionage. Other than that, not a thing to see.

The White House communications director Mike Dubke is resigning after three months on the job. President Donald Trump accepted his resignation on May 18; however, Dubke offered to stay through the president’s first foreign trip, which ended Saturday.









White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News:

“I did not know Mike Dubke before he came on as communications director, I did not know him well. I know he’s worked very hard here, but people in administrations tend to leave on their own volition as well. “

47-year-old Dubke helped found Crossroads Media, a Republican media firm in Virginia. The Trump administration remains caught up in the Russian hacking scandal. Questions remain as to whether or not the White House Communications team will see their roles change.









Conway also said:

“He has expressed his desire to leave the White House and made very clear that he would see through the president’s international trip.”

President Trump was allegedly frustrated with the way the White House communications team was handling things amidst the Russia scandal. He recently toyed with the idea of scrapping the daily press briefings altogether. He proposed holding one himself every two weeks instead of the daily press briefings.

Dubke sent the following email to his friends and colleagues:

“It has been my great honor to serve President Trump and this administration. It has also been my distinct pleasure to work side-by-side, day-by-day with the staff of the communications and press departments.”

He worked closely with Press Secretary Sean Spicer dealing with the communication strategy for the administration. His job was also to help respond to crises such as the firing of FBI director, James Comey, as well as rollout plans for policies and other White House initiatives.

Dubke arrived at the White House in mid-February as Jason Miller, former Trump campaign communications adviser, stepped down from the job. Dubke’s final day has not been set yet.

Our current president appealed to low-income, blue collar workers who were tired of being screwed by the big guy. They believed he’d put more money in their pocket and ‘drain the swamp.’

Which makes this bill all the more ironic.









Hard Working ‘Muricans

According to his supporters, President Donald Trump is all about the little guy. Trumpers claim to hate the ‘coastal elite’ because they don’t fully understand what hardworking Americans need. So congratulations, Trump supporters.

You’re about to lose your overtime pay.

If you’re an hourly worker, you’re probably aware that overtime pay is more than what you normally earn. It’s a nice incentive to burn the midnight oil because come payday, you’ll have some extra cash. But who needs money in a capitalistic society, right?









Republican legislation would give employers the option of offering an hour and a half of compensatory time for each hour of overtime worked. According to supporters of the law, there’s nothing but positivity with this legislation.

Sugar Coated Lies

This Republican piece of legislation made its way through the House on Tuesday. While it’s expected to hit some speed bumps in the Senate, a president like Trump would have no problem signing it.

Supporters suggest this is exactly what the working class needs:

For every hour of overtime worked, they will have the option of taking an hour and a half of compensatory time

Guaranteed to take it within 13 months of working the overtime

No company will be allowed to force their employees to use this option

There’s also nothing stopping them from only offering overtime to employees willing to forego overtime pay. So if you need extensive car repairs or have a hefty medical bill thanks to Trumpcare, don’t even think about earning some extra cash at work.

But hey, what’s more work for the same amount of pay if you’ll get an hour and a half off within a year or so?

Watch this video to learn more about how former President Barack Obama secured overtime pay for millions of Americans.

In some good news, a push for less discrimination and equality for the LGBTQ has had a win in Oregon. The Governor Kate Brown of Oregon signed a Transgender equality bill and has said the government has no place in “…Dictating personal identity.”

The bill, HB 2673, has been put in place to make it easier for Transgender people who wish to amend their birth certificates and other identity certificates so they state the same gender they identify with.









This is a matter that many non-transgender people might not consider as a difficulty that accompanies being transgender. Imagine feeling you were born in the wrong body and the discrimination that comes with it. Then imagine a situation where you are asked to prove your identity and the only document you can produce does not reflect who you are. It might even add ammunition to the people who may be discriminating against you. This new bill allows transgender people the dignity and ability to attain papers that are aligned with who they are much more easily.









Transgender people are discriminated against in many ways, in the workplace, socially, and they are even murdered at higher rates. This is unacceptable and any bill that pushes for the protection of this community, is a compassionate and worthy one. With this bill and thanks to Gov. Kate Brown, Transgender people can now apply for their amended identification documents in a more affordable and simpler way.

JoDee Winterhof of Human Rights Campaign(HRC) reacted with this statement:

‘By signing this legislation into law, Governor Kate Brown is helping to make Oregon an even more inviting and inclusive place for transgender people to call home. We congratulate Basic Rights Oregon on this important victory and thank Governor Brown for her continued outstanding leadership on LGBTQ equality.’

In a tweet the Governor herself said this:

At a time where the White House is moving to take away protections from the Transgender community, this is welcome, good news.

It is also evidence that progressive policies can be achieved at local levels.

Griffin later apologized for being a part of the photo shoot, but it has already cost her a shot at co-hosting CNN’s New Year’s Eve show with Anderson Cooper for the indefinite future.









But another employee of CNN, host Jake Tapper, weighed on the issue via Twitter, and while he condemned Griffin’s actions, he also reminded Trump and his GOP cohorts that they don’t exactly have clean hands when it comes to the issue:

Indecent behavior should be condemned — including not just faux presidential beheadings but, say, mocking the disabled or denigrating POWs — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 31, 2017

That’s right, Tapper did indeed put it right back in Trump’s face by reminding him of how he made fun of reporter Serge Kovaleski’s disability and said Senator John McCain wasn’t a war hero because he was captured and a POW at the infamous Hanoi Hilton.









Trump defenders on social media tried to make Tapper look like was complicit in the whole Kathy Griffin matter, but he was more than equal to their taunts:

I can rule out that anyone I spoke to or heard from in any way thought it was anything but disgusting and offensive — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 31, 2017

And then criticism from the left arrived from Rosie O’Donnell. Again, Tapper managed to keep his cool and make it clear he didn’t have time for divisiveness from either side of the political spectrum:

AND DO U DENOUNCE ALL THE RIGHT WING MORONS WHO SPEW HATRED AND LIES ON UR NETWORK DAILY JAKE – TALK AOUT DISGUSTING AND INAPPROPRIATE #USA — ROSIE (@Rosie) May 31, 2017

it his show – same with anderson – if its got ur name in the title – all that takes place on it is up to U – say no to the assholes – easy — ROSIE (@Rosie) May 31, 2017

OK: no. — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 31, 2017

Personally, while I disagree with the photos Griffin agreed to be a part of, I also see it as part of a larger karmic balance coming into play. Donald Trump constantly attacks people in petty, personal, and and offensive ways. If some of that comes back on him–say in the form of a special counsel named Robert Mueller who winds up exposing the president for the traitor he is–I certainly won’t shed a tear for the jerk who betrayed his own country.

President Donald Trump’s ascent to office seems to have emboldened the scum of the Earth. The man who has been arrested in Portland, Oregon for fatally stabbing two people and wounding another on the MAX train is a well-known white supremacist named Jeremy Christian.









He was reportedly screaming hate speech at a woman wearing a hijab when two men confronted him. Christian attacked the men with a knife, stabbing them both to death and injuring another before leaving the train and eventually being apprehended.

The Portland Mercury reports that Christian has been booked for the following crimes: two charges of aggravated murder, one charge of attempted murder, two charges of intimidation (hate crime), and one charge of felon in possession of a restricted weapon.

The Portland Mercury also recalls their last run in with Jeremy Christian, writing:

“On April 29, Christian showed up to the right-wing ‘March for Free Speech’ on 82nd Avenue in Montaville with a baseball bat in an attempt to assault left-wing protesters. The bat was quickly confiscated by Portland police officers. He ranted how he was a nihilist. He’d soon yelled racial slurs (“fuck all you n*****s”) and gave the Nazi salute throughout the day. He yelled ‘Hail Vinland’ throughout the day.”









The Mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, issued this statement in regards to this horrible hate crime:

“There is too much hatred in our world right now, and far too much violence. Too much of it has arrived here in Portland. My heart goes out to the families of those who lost their lives, and to those who witnessed what happened. Thank you to our first responders, who provided aid, and police who captured the suspected killer. Now is the time, we must come together as a community and love one another. We must reject hatred and violence. We must seek justice.”

Think our President will comment on this one?

"It’s official: another US District Court rejected President Donald Trump’s reviled travel ban. The 4th Circuit judges focused on Trump’s campaign remarks about Muslims and the administration’s flimsy national security excuses. They majority opinion said that language of the ban “drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination,” and likely violated the Establishment Clause of the Constitution:

“The evidence in the record, viewed from the standpoint of the reasonable observer, creates a compelling case that the (Executive Order’s) primary purpose is religious. Then-candidate Trump’s campaign statements reveal that on numerous occasions, he expressed anti-Muslim sentiment, as well as his intent, if elected, to ban Muslims from the United States.”









Another wholesale defeat for the Trump travel ban. But you know the fight is not over.

Next step, the Supreme Court of the United States. And the little details of the order, and the law, will enter into the equation. More importantly, however, is the judicial philosophy that the judges take.









The power of the judicial branch is to interpret the law, and there is no higher interpreters in the land than the Supreme Court. Will they consider Trump’s campaign statements in their decision? The lower circuits have, but the Supreme Court does not have to if they don’t think it it is judicially necessary. Ineffective to this point is the executive power argument, but it is something that SCOTUS will have to look at again. As to whether the ban is justified by national security concerns, a dissenting judge wrote:

“Unless corrected by the Supreme Court, the majority’s new approach, which is unsupported by any Supreme Court case, will become a sword for plaintiffs to challenge facially neutral government actions, particularly those affecting regions dominated by a single religion.”

No doubt that lawyers who have already successfully challenged the ban are ready to blow big holes in that argument, but the fact remains that they’ll likely have to do one more time: in front of the most powerful Court in the land.

Until then, Trump’s ban remains shelved. Where it belongs.

Today, the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, upheld the lower court ruling that blocks President Donald Trump’s administration from temporarily suspending new visas for people from the primarily Muslim countries of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.









The Washington Post reported on Trump being handed another legal blow in his efforts to block the issuance of new visas to citizens of six Muslim majority countries.

An appeals court refused to reinstate Trump’s revised travel ban. The case will likely go to the Supreme Court. https://t.co/SpBZOPXN3s — The New York Times (@nytimes) May 25, 2017

Chief Circuit Judge Roger L. Gregory wrote in a majority opinion, joined in part by nine other judges:

“Congress granted the president broad power to deny entry to aliens, but that power is not absolute. It cannot go unchecked when, as here, the president wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation.”

The 4th Circuit declined to lift the Maryland federal judge’s original order, which ruled against the travel ban in March. Opponents of the ban assert that it violates the Constitution by intentionally singling out Muslims for discrimination. Today’s ruling leaves the injunction in place. This will allow citizens from Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Syria, and Yemen to continue to enter the United States.









The freeze on the travel ban would still have stayed in place even if the appeals court had sided with the Administration, Trump’s order is also being held because of a federal judge in Hawaii, whose opinion also is against the ban. The Justice Department appealed the Hawaii decision in oral arguments on May 15 at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

During oral arguments, the 4th Circuit judges expressed misgivings about the viability of Trump’s order. It has been questioned – and disproved – whether there is a link between barring of citizens from Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Syria, and Yemen actually ensures national security.

#BREAKING: Appeals court upholds lower court's block of Trump travel ban https://t.co/ZUOtIG3ZKT pic.twitter.com/HpoTzYwZnQ — The Hill (@thehill) May 25, 2017

The Justice Department does not want to address whether Trump’s order violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment in addition to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Crucial to this case is the issue of whether courts should consider Trump’s past statements about wanting to bar Muslims from entering the country. Some of the judges on the appeals court were skeptical about the use of past statements by Trump.

Trump, not being one to learn a lesson easily, will likely appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

"A celebrity name has been put forward as a Democratic candidate for the Governor of Ohio. He has been a talk show host, more famous for entertainment, and yet far more politically experienced than the current president, Donald Trump.

Give up?









It is none other than Jerry Springer.

Yes, as in “Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!” That one.

Ted Strickland, former Governor of Ohio, told Business Insider that he had been speaking with Jerry Springer about the possibility. Strickland, who also ran for the senate last year, said he had:

“…Been doing whatever I could to encourage any of those who are talking about running … and I think it’s important that we win and that we have the strongest possible candidate.”

Expanding on why Springer would be a good choice, Strickland then added that Springer:

“…Certainly would start out with wide name.”

The world was stunned when reality TV star Trump, a man with no military or political experience, managed to pull off the fluke of the millennium by winning the presidency last year.









However, Jerry Springer does have actual political experience dating back to the 1970s. He has been the Mayor of Cincinnati, but he has also unsuccessfully attempted to be the Democratic nominee for the Governor of Ohio in 1982. He has also talked of running again in the early 2000s and again just a few years ago.

Springer has been a lawyer, a musician, and played an active role in his hometown of Cincinnati, even helping to save the Cincinnati Union Terminal. He is most famous for his sensational and over the top television show, The Jerry Springer Show. This program was hugely successful and made him a household name. It was the show that brought other people’s domestic disputes into America’s living rooms.

It seems he is still popular enough that Democrats such as Strickland are keen to use his well known status to ensure a win as Governor.

While all of this speculation goes on, Springer himself has thrown water on the idea as he recently tweeted this:

Article about me running for Ohio Gov? If I throw my hat in the ring, I'll let folks know. Right now, I don't even have a hat! — Jerry Springer (@jerryspringer) May 30, 2017

I guess we will have to wait and see.

Chris Falcinelli recently tweeted an idea which had been on his mind for 20 years – the simple idea that President Donald Trump is a “dumb person’s idea of a smart person.”









His idea caught on quickly and people had a field day with it, tweeting things such as:

Trump is a dumb person's idea of a smart person, a poor person's idea of a rich person, and a weak person's idea of a strong person. — Oakland Zoo (@oaklandzoo22) May 23, 2017

They say #Trump is a dumb person's idea of a smart person.

Really?

Are sure he's not a brain dead person's idea of a smart person? — (((Timothy Thelen))) (@timmthelen) May 16, 2017

Trump is a dumb person's idea of a smart man. He is bigly ignorant, bigly shallow, bigly incompetent and a President Apprentice at best! — Ricardo Rodriguez (@Rickyrod912) May 2, 2017

Falcinelli’s reasons for his claim that Donald Trump is a dumb person’s idea of a smart person:

1) Dumb jocks have been telling us for years that they read Trump’s books.

2) “Trump was rich. He was ostentatiously, famously rich. Everybody wanted to be rich, but not everybody was. The logic flowed easily: being rich meant you were competing well, and outfoxing everyone, and you were therefore smart. Possession of money is the easiest thing to understand. Trump is filthy rich and therefore, must be intelligent.”









3) Trump has consistently been telling people he is smart. In doing so, he has successfully convinced people that it’s true.

He concluded by saying:

“It was all true. Trump is the dumbest version of smart, and the most hideous form of rich, and the weakest, most transparently pathetic kind of strong. But in the same way that Scrapple is a meat, and Milli Vanilli was a musical act, and the Cleveland Browns are a football team, Trump is smart and rich and strong.

At least if you are dumb.”

Thank you, Chris Falcinelli, for articulating the truth so well!

"The Simpsons have had no qualms about bashing President Donald Trump, especially considering they predicted he would ascend to the office almost twenty years ago. The show released a new short on Friday, continuing to poke the bear in light of the newest controversies that surround the house that Trump built.









The skit sees Trump, surrounded by books like How To Lose Friends And Piss Off Israel and I’m Still Fired by Bill O’Reilly, trying to make nice with recently ousted FBI Director James Comey:

“Look, I want a do-over. I have no tapes; let’s make a deal. You hand over all your notes, and I’ll erase the tapes… I mean there are no tapes! No tapes!”









Trump, just like what continues to happen in his real presidency, is visited by the ghost of Richard Nixon who has some backhanded praise for our current POTUS:

“I came to thank you, Donald. I’m moving up! Thanks to you, I’m now the 44th-best President! I just have one piece of advice: if you have tapes, burn ’em!”

Perhaps the best gag of all comes near the end, however, when President Trump asks Comey for a hug. The visual of the two men embracing each other is bizarre and hilarious (remember, Comey is six feet, eight inches tall). Even Nixon gets in on it, finally experiencing a hug for the first time in his life. The skit ends by showing a calendar with the heading “Here’s What’s Left” and expressing how many of us feel:

“Paid for by the committee to turn the clock ahead to 2020, or back to whenever. Just not here.”

You can watch the entire short below; the framed Monopoly card on Trump’s wall is a nice touch, as is the weird leprechaun Jeff Sessions. Keep exposing those frauds for what they are, Homer J. Simpson.

Trump’s Twitter rants are starting to take their toll on all of us. Even his own aides are becoming nervous about what he is spewing out to the rest of the world. One official told the Wall Street Journal that they organized what he called an “intervention.”









After hearing about this, CBS late-night show host, Stephen Colbert, decided to stage a “Twitter-vention” of his own saying:

“But there are plenty of us who have been deeply affected by President Trump’s tweets.”

Colbert pulled out a piece of paper and pretended to read:

“Dear President Trump, your tweeting has affected me in the following ways: My ratings are up.”

His audience then applauded and cheered.









From a Washington Post article:

“He’s not wrong; “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” is projected to be this season’s most-watched late-night program, CBS announced Tuesday. It’s the first time in over a decade that CBS has beaten NBC in overall late-night audience with a season-long host.”

Colbert, probably Trump’s biggest late night show critic, has been using his show as a huge platform to respond to the president’s crazy antics. He recently tweeted this:

Trump talked smack about me in TIME mag. If only I had a nightly show to respond on…oh yeah, I do! Join us, won't you? 11:35 #briarpatch — Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) May 12, 2017

On Tuesday, Colbert ended his monologue by joking some more about how Trump’s tweets have affected his show. He said:

“But President Trump, some nights half of my monologue is just about things you’ve tweeted. You’re squeezing out other fun news stories. Did you know San Francisco is opening a rat cafe? They are. That’s real. You took that away from me!”

“We want you to accept help, or at the very least, auto-correct. How many ways can you misspell ‘independent counsel?’ So, please give up this harmful addiction and try another coping mechanism. Have you tried drinking? ‘Cause that’s what I’ve been doing, and it’s going pretty great.”

President Donald Trump made the headlines again this week for all the wrong reasons. While on his first trip abroad he proved his arrogance by rudely barging past the Montenegro Prime Minister Dusko Markovic to make sure he was front and center for a group photograph.

The childish act was noticed and scorned by many even though PM Markovic brushed it off as “inoffensive” and stated “it is natural that the president of the United States is in the front row.”









One of the funniest responses has come from bawdy actress, singer, and all-around funny woman Bette Midler.

Midler, who has been a vocal Trump critic, chimed in on Trump’s latest embarrassing and child-like behavior with a creative suggestion on why Trump might have been compelled to lay his tiny hands upon another human:

You see Trump shove Montenegro’s PM to get to the front of NATO group? Hes j just longing for human contact since his wife won’t touch him. — Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) May 25, 2017

It has been noted on this trip that Trump’s wife, First Lady Melania Trump, has shooed Trump’s hand away more than once, when he has attempted to hold hers.









Midler put two and two together. Perhaps she is on to something? Some curious observations have been made about the Trumps. From Trump walking ahead of his wife, her smiles that turn to instant frowns, strange tweets from both of them, and refusals to hold hands, along with many other events, have made people speculate about the state of their relationship. Many are questioning if there is trouble in paradise? Or even was it ever paradise?

There is a photo with the pope where Melania looks downright forlorn and miserable. The photo has sparked a wave of hilarious memes.

Could this manhandling of a foreign dignitary be simply a case of what Midler is putting forward? Is it a desperate call out for human touch? Is he feeling unloved? Did the Prime Minister of Montenegro somehow fill a kind of void in Trump’s personal life?

This is Trump’s third marriage and from the outside, their relationship looks like it is under pressure – Midler is just another celebrity who has noticed.

Last summer, Dani Mathers, the 2015 Playboy Playmate of the Year, got the bright idea to take a picture of a naked woman in an LA Fitness club and post it to Snapchat. Since then, she has lost her reputation and her longtime gig at a radio station. On Thursday, she learned that she’d lost her freedom as well. After finally realizing that she was in a battle she couldn’t win, she pleaded no contest in return for three years’ probation and one month of community service.









For those who missed it, Mathers snapped a picture of a then 70-year-old naked woman at LA Fitness. She uploaded it to Snapchat next to a picture of herself with her hand over her mouth as if stifling a laugh. The caption read, “If I can’t unsee this than you can’t either.” She deleted the picture within minutes, but the damage was already done. Within hours, LA Fitness banned her from ever entering one if its clubs again. KLOS, Southern California’s longtime album rock powerhouse, bounced her from her longtime gig on the “Heidi & Frank” morning show.

Mathers’ attempt to apologize only poured gasoline on the fire. She claimed that she only intended it to be part of a private conversation with one of her friends. The relentless bombardment she’d taken on social media continued unabated, and she was briefly forced to wall off her social media accounts.

In November, Los Angeles city attorney Mike Feuer formally charged Mathers with misdemeanor invasion of privacy. Mathers initially pleaded not guilty, even though she had apologized. Last week, she tried to have the case thrown out, claiming there was no way to identify the woman. A judge rejected that gambit, and Mathers was due to face trial starting this coming Friday.









Over the next week, however, Mathers realized she faced extremely long odds. Not only is society’s tolerance for body shaming at an all-time low, but it was awfully hard to reconcile her apology with what looked like legal hair-splitting. Two days before her trial was due to start, she opted to change her plea to no contest. Watch here, via “Inside Edition.”

As part of her plea–which has the effect of a guilty plea–Mathers is not allowed to have a cell phone or any other recording device in a locker room or anywhere else “where persons may be in a state of undress.” The judge also ordered her not to take pictures or video of others without permission, or post them online without permission.

She must also serve her community service by helping remove graffiti in Los Angeles. According to TMZ, had she not opted for community service, she would have faced 45 days in the county jail. In a unique twist, she must pay the victim $60 in restitution to help the victim buy a new backpack. The old backpack had been featured in the now-infamous Snapchat picture, and the victim feared being recognized as long as she wore it. Anyone who thinks this was a big fuss over nothing should keep this in mind.

Feuer told The New York Times that when this case broke, he was “incredulous” that there was no real penalty for posting a body-shaming picture online, even though taking one is clearly illegal. He persuaded the state legislature to consider a bill that would force those who post such pictures to foot the bill for removing it from the Internet. The state senate passed it unanimously; it’s now pending in the state assembly. Nonetheless, he was happy that Mathers finally came to her senses, since the message is now clear that “body shaming is not tolerated in our city.”

Mathers’ lawyer, Thomas Mesereau, said that his client apologized “from the bottom of her heart” for any harm that she caused. If you were really sorry, Dani, why did you drag it out this long?

Mathers hopes to go to nursing school once this is over. I’m not sure I would trust her in a position that requires that kind of trust, at least not this soon. Hopefully she can come learn from this–just not right away.

Last summer, Dani Mathers, the 2015 Playboy Playmate of the Year, got the bright idea to take a picture of a naked woman in an LA Fitness club and post it to Snapchat. Since then, she has lost her reputation and her longtime gig at a radio station. On Thursday, she learned that she’d lost her freedom as well. After finally realizing that she was in a battle she couldn’t win, she pleaded no contest in return for three years’ probation and one month of community service.









For those who missed it, Mathers snapped a picture of a then 70-year-old naked woman at LA Fitness. She uploaded it to Snapchat next to a picture of herself with her hand over her mouth as if stifling a laugh. The caption read, “If I can’t unsee this than you can’t either.” She deleted the picture within minutes, but the damage was already done. Within hours, LA Fitness banned her from ever entering one if its clubs again. KLOS, Southern California’s longtime album rock powerhouse, bounced her from her longtime gig on the “Heidi & Frank” morning show.

Mathers’ attempt to apologize only poured gasoline on the fire. She claimed that she only intended it to be part of a private conversation with one of her friends. The relentless bombardment she’d taken on social media continued unabated, and she was briefly forced to wall off her social media accounts.

In November, Los Angeles city attorney Mike Feuer formally charged Mathers with misdemeanor invasion of privacy. Mathers initially pleaded not guilty, even though she had apologized. Last week, she tried to have the case thrown out, claiming there was no way to identify the woman. A judge rejected that gambit, and Mathers was due to face trial starting this coming Friday.









Over the next week, however, Mathers realized she faced extremely long odds. Not only is society’s tolerance for body shaming at an all-time low, but it was awfully hard to reconcile her apology with what looked like legal hair-splitting. Two days before her trial was due to start, she opted to change her plea to no contest. Watch here, via “Inside Edition.”

As part of her plea–which has the effect of a guilty plea–Mathers is not allowed to have a cell phone or any other recording device in a locker room or anywhere else “where persons may be in a state of undress.” The judge also ordered her not to take pictures or video of others without permission, or post them online without permission.

She must also serve her community service by helping remove graffiti in Los Angeles. According to TMZ, had she not opted for community service, she would have faced 45 days in the county jail. In a unique twist, she must pay the victim $60 in restitution to help the victim buy a new backpack. The old backpack had been featured in the now-infamous Snapchat picture, and the victim feared being recognized as long as she wore it. Anyone who thinks this was a big fuss over nothing should keep this in mind.

Feuer told The New York Times that when this case broke, he was “incredulous” that there was no real penalty for posting a body-shaming picture online, even though taking one is clearly illegal. He persuaded the state legislature to consider a bill that would force those who post such pictures to foot the bill for removing it from the Internet. The state senate passed it unanimously; it’s now pending in the state assembly. Nonetheless, he was happy that Mathers finally came to her senses, since the message is now clear that “body shaming is not tolerated in our city.”

"The nephew of former President George H.W. Bush and cousin of former President George W. Bush, Billy Bush, is returning to TV after the infamous Pussygate scandal last year during election season.









Back in October of 2016, The Washington Post leaked behind-the-scenes audio from an Access Hollywood special back in 2005 with Billy Bush and the now President Donald Trump.

During the audio, Trump uttered the now infamous line saying that women just let him “grab them by the pussy.”

Somehow, Billy Bush was the one who ended up with a career ruined while Donald Trump got the presidency. Bush said about the incident:

“That early part was just chaos. But then things progressed, and when you have a big, traumatic event, you go through stages, and it led to acceptance and understanding. And then I found myself in a place of soul searching. And I developed a commitment to become a better, fuller man.”

He went on to say:

“I felt that, in that moment, he was being typically Donald, which is performing and shocking. Almost like Andrew Dice Clay, the stand-up comedian: Does he really do the things that he’s saying or is that his act? And in Donald’s case, I equated it that way. When he said what he said, I’d like to think if I had thought for a minute that there was a grown man detailing his sexual assault strategy to me, I’d have called the FBI.”









He was fired from Access Hollywood after the tape surfaced. Yet, Trump got out of the scandal unscathed. Trump was the one saying the offensive things about picking up married women and grabbing women because he is famous.

Because he spent so much time with Trump, Bush had to kind of learn to deal with the crassness. However, I think he should’ve said something about it.

Bush is developing a new series to show viewers a different side of him. It will likely involve pop culture, sports, and interviews, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

"John Oliver’s HBO show, Last Week Tonight, did something a little different this week. They went over the news of the last week. He is calling the scandals “Stupid Watergate” because it has:

“… All the potential ramifications of Watergate but where everyone involved is stupid and bad at everything.”









He set out to answer the following questions:

“What the fuck is going on?”

“How big a deal is this?”

“Where do we go from here?”

“Is this real life?”

Oliver started by breaking down all of the crazy news stories of the last week. He started with the story of Trump leaking highly classified intelligence to Russian officials who were visiting the Oval Office. This is code-word information that shouldn’t be shared with even your closest friends. In Trump’s case, Oliver points out that it is:

“…The golf caddie he calls Steve, even though his name is Doug, a bucket of KFC chicken and the ghost of Roger Ailes.”









Oliver also pointed out that Fox News doesn’t seem to think that these stories are particularly important, which is insane! Of course, as Oliver put it:

“A Fox host not being able to hold his doubts at bay for 48 hours is pretty much a canary in a coal mine, but then at this point, Donald Trump is basically waist deep in canaries.”

He also said this epic quip about Trump:

“It seems like with President Trump that he’s always approaching the end of the line, but it never seems to come, as if for him, and him alone, the end of the line is drawn by MC [bleeping] Escher.”

He then ended the segment talking about how much Trump doesn’t really seem to be enjoying the job. He talked about Trump’s 100-day interview in which he said that he preferred his old life and that he thought being president would be easier. To which, Oliver replied:

“I too, preferred my previous life, before he became president.”

Traditionally, country music artists and their audiences have been known as politically conservative. However, that image seems to be changing. Amidst country music artists, both ends of the political spectrum can be seen.

There have been a few musicians who have been very vocal regarding their opposition to Trump and his policies – Sturgill Simpson, Margo Price, Jason Isbell, and Kacey Musgraves. There are others who are very pro-Trump including Justin Moore, Chris Janson, Charlie Daniels, and Ronnie Dunn.









Sturgill Simpson, who is known as an outsider in the country music world, just took home a Grammy award for “Best Country Album,” and one week after this, he released the ballad “All Around You.” The music video is a strong display of opposition to the president and his dangerous policies.

“The man’s face is shrouded by shadows, but the silhouette is unmistakable: comb-over hairdo, thick neck, beefy red power tie. Two fists, bronzed and engorged like mylar balloons, pump skyward from a podium in a pugilistic dominance display.”

“It ends in an act of left-wing wish-fulfillment, with a boy in a cape destroying both the podium and a massive, barbed border wall, allowing a procession of brown-skinned immigrants to march into golden light.”

Jason Isbell tweeted this sign he posted on the door of their hospital room after his daughter was born:









I made a sign for our hospital room door. pic.twitter.com/A5wE3bXG6Y — Jason Isbell (@JasonIsbell) September 4, 2015

Kacey Musgraves also took to Twitter to oppose the Secretary of Education, Betsy Devos:

I mean…you decide for yourself but this is a huge red flag to me. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Sucks that money means more than mind https://t.co/Vye5jAOlEl — KACEY MUSGRAVES (@KaceyMusgraves) February 5, 2017

The Dixie Chicks’ lead singer, Natalie Maines, sparked a huge controversy in 2003 when she voiced her opposition to President George W. Bush in reference to the Iraq war. She said:

“Just so you know, we’re ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas.”

In 2003, in hopes of resurrecting their career, the Dixie Chicks produced a new album with the song “Not Ready To Make Nice.” Daniel Schorn said:

“The song is powerful and unrepentant. The anger isn’t directed at the war or the president — or at their many fans who deserted them. It’s about the hatred, and narrow-minded intolerance they encountered for expressing an opinion.”

Maren Morris tweeted this, referencing a death threat that Maines received at the height of the Dixie Chicks controversy:

It's a shame the ""shut up and sing"" mentality is still alive and well. I mean, DAMN. We're polarized as fuck. — MAREN MORRIS (@MarenMorris) January 21, 2017

Even in 2017, it’s still not acceptable for musical artists to speak their political opinions. There are many other country artists who choose to remain quiet about their political leanings. Rowdy Yates, morning show host on 98.5 KVOO in Tulsa, Oklahoma, told BuzzFeed News:

“I know one very, very popular artist who, in private settings, is a big Democrat … but politics is the hottest potato around right now. I think a lot of artists are saying, ‘You know what, I’d rather not catch this son of a bitch; I’ll pass it to somebody else.’”

A search of Federal Election Commission records showed that no top Billboard artists contributed to Trump’s campaign. Nashville Democrat, Tim McGraw, did contribute to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Country musicians are most likely divided in their political leanings.

Diane Pecknold, a country music scholar and women’s and gender studies professor at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, said:

“I think there used to be a belief in the country music industry that there was a particular, relatively homogenous group they were speaking to.”

“That is definitely not the case anymore. There’s a lot more young people in the country audience than there used to be, and there’s a lot more urban[-dwelling] people.”

A CNN host recently cracked on air, and ended up apologizing to his guest. While some people were upset, there were plenty of others who basically thanked him.









Russian Smoke

CNN host Anderson Cooper has lost his composure before on his show, Anderson Cooper 360. One of his most notable moments was the infamous eye roll at Kellyanne Conway.

The bar has now officially been raised.

While speaking with conservative commentator Jeffrey Lord, an avid supporter of President Donald Trump, he mentioned the whole Russian scandal. Specifically what he said during his meeting with Russian envoys:

“I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.”

Despite the suspicious firing of James Comey, as he got closer to Russian smoke followed by Trump reassuring the Russian envoys that he wasn’t under investigation, Lord defended our president:

“I don’t care what he says to the Russians.”

Cooper was done.

Dump

After listening to Lord meddle his way through defending Trump’s actions, Cooper stated the obvious to everyone who was watching:

“If Trump took a dump on his desk, you would defend it.”









Lord laughed and Cooper backtracked a little bit, saying it’s great to be so loyal to someone. He also ended up apologizing on Twitter, where plenty of people actually thanked him for stating the obvious.

I regret the crude sentence i spoke earlier tonight and followed it up by apologizing on air. It was unprofessional. I am genuinely sorry. — Anderson Cooper (@andersoncooper) May 20, 2017

@ParkerMolloy @andersoncooper @brianstelter I think whoever's idea it was to hire Lord should apologize to Anderson as well. — Eric Braun (@TheDakotacrat) May 20, 2017

@anildash @andersoncooper Or mocking a handicapped reporter, bashing a gold star family, downplaying a Vietnam POW's captivity, accusing his predecessor of a felony — Robert Maguire (@RobertMaguire_) May 20, 2017

His supporters have proven to be disturbingly loyal. They got off on yelling “lock her up” during the campaign, even though nothing bad happened with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails. And yet they continue to look past the Russian smoke.

Let’s not forget what Trump himself said about his own supporters:

“I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters.”

Cooper is an easygoing commentator. If he can’t take it anymore, and blows his lid from time to time, then imagine how us regular folks must feel.

"Have you heard any of these wacky terms floating around the internet? Here is an explanation of some of the memes and terms used by the uber-conservative, so-called “alt-right” movement.

What comes to your mind when you hear the word ‘Trump” – ignorant, liar, con man, misogynist pig, asshole, narcissist? The Quinnipiac University poll asked 1,078 voters the first word that came to their mind when they thought about ‘Trump.’

The answer that stood out the most was “idiot,” followed by incompetent, liar, leader, and unqualified. This should not be shocking to most people, but it is truly scary.

People are overwhelmingly saying these things about the leader of our country and not without good reason!

Here’s what people on Twitter think when they hear “Trump”:

What word do you think of when you hear ""Trump""? RT for more votes. — Southrn Fried Nfidel (@SFriedInfidel) May 11, 2017

I asked my 10 yr old cousin what do you think of when you hear the name "" Donald Trump "" she said "" racist "".. there you have it America.

I think we can all totally agree now… Donald Trump is an idiot. — Ben Wild (@iBenWild) May 16, 2017

Our President is officially an idiot. Why is it that a man with no attention span constantly demands ours? https://t.co/AcAyzRq1Zw





— ThisLandisOurLand (@ThisLandisOurs) May 16, 2017

The same Quinnipiac University Poll also gave President Trump a very low, 36 percent approval rating. It may be even more telling that 61 percent of people said he was dishonest and over half agreed that he is a bad leader. A large two-thirds majority of the participants also agreed that he is not level headed.

In a nutshell, most Americans do not get positive vibes when they hear the word “Trump!”

"Comedian Dave Chappelle is taking back the hopeful message he gave about President Donald Trump back in November.









In the first episode of Saturday Night Live, Chappelle said at the end of his opening monologue:

“So, in that spirit, I’m wishing Donald Trump luck. And I’m going to give him a chance, and we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one too. Thank you very much.”

On Monday, Chappelle spoke at a benefit for the Robin Hood Foundation and he apologized for saying this according to NBC’s Willie Geist.

Dave Chappelle tonight in NY on his November SNL monologue: ""I was the first guy on TV to say 'Give Trump a chance.' I f***ed up. Sorry."" — Willie Geist (@WillieGeist) May 16, 2017

Even in apologizing, he joked when Chappelle said:

“Every day, we wake up never knowing what he’s going to do next, Donald Trump. He’s exciting like you thought a black president would have been.”

He also disagreed with the critics who accused him of going soft on Trump:









“I said we demand he gives us a chance. I didn’t softball ’em. Welcome to the world, this is how it goes—tyranny of the majority, or tyranny of the minority in this case. I feel like a lot of people in America understand what the political process felt like for disenfranchised people.”

This comes after the shitstorm of the entire Trump administration thus far. This week, Trump leaked classified intel to a Russian ambassador who was visiting the White House. During a Fox News interview, Trump talked about a CIA hacking and blamed the Obama administration for it.

Last week, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey at the behest of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The letter Sessions sent to Trump read in part after the jump):

“It is essential that this Department of Justice clearly reaffirm its commitment to longstanding principles that ensure the integrity and fairness of federal investigations and prosecutions. The Director of the FBI must be someone who follows faithfully the rules and principles of the Department of Justice and who sets the right example for our law enforcement officials and others in the Department.”

It seemed almost too good to be true. This last week was probably the worst yet for President Donald Trump’s White House team, and the same week that Melissa McCarthy was returning to Saturday Night Live.









There was obviously plenty of good material to draw from with Trump’s firing of James Comey and then essentially admitting that he did so because of the Russia investigation, throwing his entire team under the bus in an attempt to look like a decision-maker. The real buzz surrounded McCarthy’s outrageous portrayal of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who made a hilarious and bizarre return in the night’s best sketch.

The hype began when footage of McCarthy’s Spicer driving his podium through New York City surfaced a few days ago.

Take two. Melissa McCarthy sliding through the streets of New York in full #SNL Sean Spicer character pic.twitter.com/HC3Uc4QnSx — Samantha Barry (@samanthabarry) May 12, 2017

The skit began with Sarah Huckabee Sanders filling in for Spicer, who was still fulfilling his Navy Reserve duties. However, a reporter quickly pointed out that Spicer was merely hiding in the bushes outside.

Soon, Spicer invaded the press conference, blasting reporters with a fire extinguisher, telling them to shut up, and bringing out a series of Russian nesting dolls to help tell his story (which included a nesting doll painted as Slimer from Ghostbusters, to whom Spicer referred as Steve Bannon).









Spicer also read his bank routing number and threw a pillar at the assembled press. Spicer was eventually confronted with the fact that, just maybe, his “friend” Donald Trump might be lying to him, and may be ready to fire him.

He took his motorized lectern on a road trip to find Trump in order to confront him.

Naturally, Alec Baldwin returned as the President himself. And if Trump is really as upset with a woman playing Spicer as it was reported he was, then he is going to be very upset with how the last minute of this skit turned out.

Back in 2013, the owner of Liberal America, Tiffany Willis, did a list of dumb Republican quotes. We’ve found some recent additions for her list, so without further ado, here are more stupid Republican quotes for you to facepalm at:

1. Trumplethinskin And His Wall

At his campaign launch, Trump said:

“I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me. Believe me. And I’ll build it very inexpensively. I’ll build a great, great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.”









2. The Ridiculousness That Launched His Campaign

Trump said this at his campaign launch:

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

3. Limbaugh On Women

Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh actually said:

“Look at what they [Democrats] are doing to women with their policies: They’re demeaning them, they’re turning them into nothing but abortion machines. There’s so much that we could be doing to just fight back, but the Republican Party, even if they had all the money in the world right now, doesn’t seem inclined to do any of this.”

4. Comparing Women To Cancer Patients

Ken Buck, a Colorado district attorney, said:

“Yes, I am pro-life. While I understand a woman wants to be in control of her body — it’s certainly the feeling that I had when I was a cancer patient, I wanted to be in control of the decisions that were made concerning my body — there is another fundamental issue at stake. And that’s the life of the unborn child.”









5. Ben Carson And His Pyramids

This idiot. Ben Carson is not a historian:

“My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain. Now all the archaeologists think that they were made for the pharaohs’ graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. And I don’t think it’d just disappear over the course of time to store that much grain.”

6. Michele Bachman. That Is All.

She thinks Obama was wiping ISIS from the terror training manuals for FBI agents:

“And now Obama is allowing terror suspect groups to write the FBI’s terror training manual.”

7. Rick Santorum On Contraception.

This asshole:

“One of the things I will talk about, that no president has talked about before, is I think the dangers of contraception in this country. It’s not okay. It’s a license to do things in a sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be. [Sex] is supposed to be within marriage.”

8. Mitt Romney On Foreclosure.

At least he didn’t say “Bah humbug!” He might as well have:

“Don’t try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom, allow investors to buy homes, put renters in them, fix the homes up and let it turn around and come back up.”

9. Mike Huckabee On Obama’s Terrorism Plans

Yes, he actually said this shit on Faux Noise:

“After this attack in West Africa, Obama’s new domestic terrorism plan probably requires Americans to memorize Koran verses.”

10. Carly Fiorina On Planned Parenthood.

She said this about those Planned Parenthood tapes:

“As regards Planned Parenthood, anyone who has watched this videotape, I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. This is about the character of our nation, and if we will not stand up in and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us.”

11. George Pataki on abortion.

He said:

“We can put an absolute ban on taxpayer funds paying for abortions.”

One problem, George. You already can’t use taxpayer funds for abortions.

12. Mike Huckabee On Transgender Soldiers

This doesn’t even make sense!

“The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is to kill people and break things.”

13. John Kasich And His Analogies

He referred to our drug problem with the phrase, “a tsunami of drugs.”

14. Steve Hickey on Gay Sex

Gross.

“Gay sex is not good for the body or mind. Pardon a crude comparison but regarding men with men, we are talking about a one-way meant only for the garbage truck to go down.”

15. Bill O’Reilly on Voters

Yes, he actually said this shit.

“Many American citizens are simply dumb. They don’t know anything. And when you don’t know anything, you’ll buy anything and propaganda rules.”

On Tuesday, Ellen DeGeneres poked fun at President Trump’s gross ignorance of U.S. history. Trump’s recent comments about Andrew Jackson and The Civil War have sparked a lot of attention. Previously, Trump had also implied that the abolitionist, Frederick Douglas, was still living, and he praised both Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson who were large rivals.









Should we laugh or cry about a president who is so fundamentally ignorant when it comes to important matters? Once again, Ellen proves that the only way we can sometimes cope with having a lunatic in office is by having a good laugh.

Watch her latest spoof:

Others are having fun too at the expense of the president’s idiocy:

On a more serious note, Aidan Quigley writes:

“Trump particularly stands out from former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush, who all took an intense interest in history.”

Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, said:

“They were all people who had read about the past, they were very invested in thinking of themselves in the trajectory of other presidents.”

“That’s not who [Trump] is. … He’s not someone who reads deeply, he’s not someone who even identifies, necessarily, with the long trajectory of presidents.”

In comparison to his predecessor, Quigley also said:

“Obama’s interest in history was reflected clearly in his speeches, especially his second inaugural address. That speech was full of allusions, including to the Revolutionary War, Lincoln, the Civil War and John F. Kennedy’s 1961 inaugural. Obama also used that speech to reference Dr. Martin Luther King and the struggle for civil rights at Seneca Falls, Selma and Stonewall.”

Most of us long for the days when we had a caring, intelligent president in office. Unfortunately, Obama isn’t going to come flying in to rescue us so I guess we will have to settle for some laughs while we’re waiting for an impeachment to take place.

It’s safe to assume that the gang on “Saturday Night Live” won’t be lacking for material this week. After all, the Sturm und Drang surrounding the firing of James Comey is enough for a whole show’s worth of skits. However, on Friday morning, New Yorkers got a tantalizing hint of who may be in for a dose of the “SNL” treatment–Sean Spicer.









During rush hour on Monday morning in Midtown Manhattan, Melissa McCarthy was out on the streets, in character as the White House press secretary–complete with motorized podium. She was there filming a skit for the following night’s show. Watch a clip here.

McCarthy reprised her ill-tempered portrayal of Spicer from this winter and spring, yelling at cars to get out of the way.









Several people whipped out their phones and started filming as McCarthy/Spicey rolled by.

CNN anchor Don Lemon and social media chief Samantha Barry started filming when McCarthy/Spicey rolled by CNN’s Manhattan studios.

Take two. Melissa McCarthy sliding through the streets of New York in full #SNL Sean Spicer character pic.twitter.com/HC3Uc4QnSx — Samantha Barry (@samanthabarry) May 12, 2017

As it turned out, McCarthy actually started trolling Spicer on Thursday. When word got out that Spicer hid in the bushes when reporters showed up at the White House to ask about Comey’s ouster, McCarthy took to Instagram with this.

Straight out da bushes @nbcsnl #snllivecoasttocoast #snl A post shared by Melissa McCarthy (@melissamccarthy) on May 11, 2017 at 10:20am PDT

And while teasing this weekend’s edition of “SNL,” McCarthy had the makeup crew transform her into Spicer.

Oh, this is beautiful.

For those who missed it, McCarthy first turned heads on February 4, when she made a surprise appearance at Studio 8H as Spicer. Watch here.

She had the part down cold, complete with alternative facts. For instance, the travel ban was not really a ban. The treatment continued a week later–when the motorized podium made its first appearance.

A few days before Easter, McCarthy’s Spicer hijacked the Easter Egg Roll to apologize for claiming Adolf Hitler, unlike Bashar al-Assad, took the high ground and didn’t use chemical weapons.

But McCarthy may have outdone herself with her latest effort to troll Spicer. If this week’s snippets are any indication, we could be about to see another “SNL” classic.

A few days before Easter, McCarthy’s Spicer hijacked the Easter Egg Roll to apologize for claiming Adolf Hitler, unlike Bashar al-Assad, took the high ground and didn’t use chemical weapons.

But McCarthy may have outdone herself with her latest effort to troll Spicer. If this week’s snippets are any indication, we could be about to see another “SNL” classic.

We’ve all watched the romantic comedies. We’ve all seen the Walt Disney movies. We have our own ideas of what romantic behavior is. But, are these behaviors really romantic? Here are some behaviors that we have all been taught are romantic, but really aren’t if you think about it. Some even border abuse.

1. Jealousy Means They Care

Two guys fighting over you may seem cute at the time, but it’s really overbearing behavior. When they are jealous of you spending time with friends and family, it’s a bit much. Think 50 Shades of Grey.

Your partner isn’t your property. They are allowed to have a separate social life; that doesn’t mean they don’t want you.

2. Intimacy Means Having No Boundaries

First, what are boundaries? Drawing boundaries means telling someone when you are and are not comfortable. If they respect your boundaries, then they won’t do the things that make you uncomfortable.

It’s about consent really, so boundaries are part of a healthy relationship. In fact, boundaries are essential. Everyone has limits. Many fictional narratives show couples violating each other’s boundaries. One example is stalking. Some movies portray it as cute, but really it’s not.









3. Constant Clashing Is A Sign Of Chemistry

This idea has been popularized by every book and TV show. Ever. For example, the book Pride and Prejudice has the main characters constantly bickering. In many narratives, the couple that is always mushy and all over each other is considered boring. The couple that bickers is always drawn back to each other. In reality, constant fighting is not a sign of a healthy relationship.

4. You Hurt Each Other Because You’re Close

This is kind of related to the last point. The in the narrative bickers and hurts each other’s feelings, but then they keep getting drawn back because they are crazy about each other. We should exercise restraint and try not to hurt our partners intentionally.

Watch this video for even more examples of tropes that are supposed to be romantic, but really aren’t:

Well, we here at Liberal America love making fun of President Donald Trump, but we aren’t the only ones. The first 100 days saw some of the funniest political cartoons of the Trump presidency so far, as well as the best anti-Trump hashtags.









This time, let’s take a look at what the rest of the world thinks of our dear Trumpykins. Here are some of the best political cartoons from around the world:

1. United Kingdom

2. Canada









3. Cuba

4. Ireland

5. Jordan

These are some seriously great cartoons, aren’t they?

You have to wonder though. This administration was a total shitstorm in its first 100 days. With the firing of now former FBI Director James Comey right as he asked for more funding to investigate the Russia Scandal, we have to ask… What’s next during these 100 days?

How much better will these cartoons get?

President Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been vandalized once again. You are not going to believe what they did to it this time. It’s a giant golden toilet. There is also a plate next to it that says “Take a Trump.”









It looks like the plate came from the broken toilet tank. TMZ reports:

“A golden toilet was placed right next to Trump’s star at some point between Saturday and Sunday, which was filled with … something wet and gross. It also looks like someone broke the toilet tank, which originally read ‘Take A Trump.'”

Here is a picture of the toilet:

Law enforcement says no one has reported the vandalism and no one is currently investigating this latest prank. This is not the first time someone has vandalized his star. Just last month, someone wrote “f**k Trump” on it.

Back in October of 2016, James Otis took a pickax and sledgehammer to the thing.









Back in July of 2016, someone built a wall around the star in protest of Trump’s plans to build a wall at the U.S. – Mexican border.

I just love the creativity with this case and with the toilet. It’s pure genius, and I’m sure President #Trumplethinskin won’t like it. Here are some Twitter reactions to the toilet:

This is not the first toilet to show up. Similar toilets have also popped up in Austin, Texas. The artist said:

“Most people just go with the status quo, and we’ll play that role of being that bump in the status quo. We’ve brought it upon ourselves to inform the public about what’s really going on.”

“The artist sent out packets with stencils for the uniform design and the team got to work placing golden toilets in ‘places that were highly visible, lots of foot traffic, that would get a lot of eyes and photos and conversation.”

The originator said that they are not actually defacing property; they just place the toilets in public places.

What if I told you that a right-wing radio host openly declared that “white power” was the only thing that keeps this country going? You’d probably wonder how he was still on the air. Well, what if I told you that host was a member of one of the most exclusive clubs in this country? Specifically, a black conservative who has bowed down to Donald Trump.









It’s been amply established that the standards to get into this club aren’t all that high. After all, consider some of its members. There’s Mark Burns, the South Carolina pastor who declared Democrats were the enemy during his benediction at the Republican National Convention, and tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton in blackface. And there’s former reality TV star Omarosa, who declared during the campaign that the country would have to bow down to Trump if he won. After Trump’s upset victory, Omarosa became a public engagement adviser to Trump, and used that role to warn a reporter that the White House had dossiers on its critics.

But black conservative pastor Jesse Lee Peterson may have outdone them all on the Wednesday edition of his radio show. During the show’s third hour, he openly declared that whites were the only ones who keep this country going. People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch got a clip.

Roughly seven minutes into the show’s third hour, Peterson and his producer, James Hake, engaged in what started out as a boilerplate case of a right-wing host offering fawning praise to Trump. Peterson said that while he had believed from the start that Trump was going to make America great again, even he was surprised by how “the light that’s within him” would “expose the darkness” in both this country and the world. Not entirely surprising, since Peterson considers Trump to be a shining example of how a real man should act.









He then praised Trump for shoving Montenegrin Prime Minister Dusko Markovic at last weekend’s NATO summit. Most of the world saw this as yet another example of boorish, bullying behavior from Trump. Not Peterson.

“He goes overseas, and as those weaklings try to get in front of him during a photo shoot, he pushed them out of the way. Obama would have stood behind in the back, and Trump went up and just grabbed the guy and pushed him out of the way. He got out in front.”

To Peterson’s mind, Trump was telling the world, “I’m the baddest man in town! A new sheriff is in town!” Hake was also pleased by it, and wanted to get the video.

But then Peterson crossed the line from mere alternative facting to something more sinister.

“White power! White power! I’m loving it. I love good. I love the light, I love it. And it doesn’t matter the color of the person that the light is coming from. I love it. I rejoice when I see men and women stand up with the love of God operating through them, overcoming evil.”

Wait a minute. In one breath, Peterson praises “white power,” then says that the color of your skin doesn’t matter if the light is shining through you?

Peterson then said that for much of Obama’s presidency, he believed that God had “given up on us” as a nation. He and Hake recalled how Hillary “sailed” through a Fox News interview in 2014. Both Peterson and Hake believed at the time that Hillary’s momentum was almost unstoppable. But Peterson claimed that one night while he was praying, God told him, “Be cool, Trump is coming. I will send my son and he will save you.”

Hake then recalled that there were a lot of white millennials, like himself, who were enamored with Trump and were “willing to fight” for him. Peterson agreed, saying that it was “beautiful” to see whites–especially young whites–“finally standing up” by suporting Trump. At that point, he really went off the deep end.

“It’s so refreshing, because if white people give up completely, it’s over for the country. It’s the whites who make things happen. Blacks and Mexicans don’t make things happen.”

Hake allowed that “very few” minorities actually do anything. Peterson agreed, allowing that “one or two” minorities at most actually make an impact. Nonetheless, the message was unmistakable–people of color really don’t do anything worth mentioning.

It turns out that this isn’t the first time Peterson has spewed something along these lines. A week after Trump took office, he dropped by Steve Malzberg’s show and claimed that only a white man like Trump could solve the rampant crime problem in areas like Chicago. Watch here.

Peterson said–with a straight face–that black men can’t “clean up their own neighborhoods” and “put their own families back together.” Only a white man can do it.

Granted, we’ve learned not to expect much from Peterson. This is a man who thinks blacks were better off before the civil rights movement, and also believes businesses should be able to discriminate with impunity. But with this latest screed, Peterson was blowing a dog whistle into a megaphone. If Malzberg, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, or any other white right-winger were to say something like this, they’d be canceled before the next break.

You may recall that earlier in the spring, after I blasted Peterson for his outrageous defense of Bill O’Reilly, Hake invited me to call into Peterson’s show. But I threw that offer back at him after his boss claimed that people who divorce are “selfish” if they remarry while their kids are still living with them. As someone who fled a marriage to an emotionally abusive woman, I considered it insulting on a personal level. It amounted to victim shaming.

As far as Hake was concerned, that made me a coward.

You want to argue behind a screen. I'm not wasting time on a closed minded coward. Call jesse or go away. — James Anton Hake (@JamesAntonHake) May 15, 2017

This is coming from a man whose boss engages in rhetoric that has no place in civilized discourse. Victim shaming, out-and-out racism, the lot. And said boss is only willing to respond in a forum that he controls. That says it all, from where I’m sitting.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department is coming under fire after released cell phone footage shows them manhandling a seventy-six year old black woman from her seat in a train station. Although there is no evidence of the woman’s race being a factor, the microscope has been extremely focused on the police over the last few years regarding the differences in how they approach whites and other races. The woman’s friend, who identifies herself only as “Tina,” captured the incident and released it to CBS Los Angeles.









The woman in the video was sitting in the “Reserved” section of the train station, as she frequently does without being bothered. When the officers approached her and asked her to leave, she showed them a card she received from a Metro officer which she claims allows her to sit in the section. The officers disagreed, the woman was arrested, and a frightening episode took place.

The woman is too frail to stand up, asks the officers to allow her to have her cane, and the following exchange occurs:

“Woman: Give me my cane.

Officer: I will give you your cane once you stand up.

Woman: No, give me my cane so I can stand up.”

As the woman continues to ask for help, the officer violently pushes her head down.









You can hear her screaming and yelling “Stop, stop!” The officer reportedly slammed her head into the wooden armrest. Tina, the woman who recorded the incident, had this to say about this despicable overreaction:

“It did not need to escalate to that point. It was past excessive in my opinion. She, I’m sure, weighs no more than 95 pounds wet. I was really shocked and traumatized witnessing this.”

The woman was released from jail, and may still face charges for obstructing an officer. All because she asked for her cane to help her stand up. The sheriff’s department is reviewing all evidence, including the video, to see whether reasonable force was used.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department is coming under fire after released cell phone footage shows them manhandling a seventy-six year old black woman from her seat in a train station. Although there is no evidence of the woman’s race being a factor, the microscope has been extremely focused on the police over the last few years regarding the differences in how they approach whites and other races. The woman’s friend, who identifies herself only as “Tina,” captured the incident and released it to CBS Los Angeles.









The woman in the video was sitting in the “Reserved” section of the train station, as she frequently does without being bothered. When the officers approached her and asked her to leave, she showed them a card she received from a Metro officer which she claims allows her to sit in the section. The officers disagreed, the woman was arrested, and a frightening episode took place.

The woman is too frail to stand up, asks the officers to allow her to have her cane, and the following exchange occurs:

“Woman: Give me my cane.

Officer: I will give you your cane once you stand up.

Woman: No, give me my cane so I can stand up.”

As the woman continues to ask for help, the officer violently pushes her head down.









You can hear her screaming and yelling “Stop, stop!” The officer reportedly slammed her head into the wooden armrest. Tina, the woman who recorded the incident, had this to say about this despicable overreaction:

“It did not need to escalate to that point. It was past excessive in my opinion. She, I’m sure, weighs no more than 95 pounds wet. I was really shocked and traumatized witnessing this.”

The woman was released from jail, and may still face charges for obstructing an officer. All because she asked for her cane to help her stand up. The sheriff’s department is reviewing all evidence, including the video, to see whether reasonable force was used.

In America today, we sentence to prison people who chuckle at the Attorney General. We incarcerate more people than any other nation on the planet. And we fire police officers who refuse to shoot mentally ill Black men.

Police officer Stephen Mader was dismissed from the Weirton, W. Va police department after rolling up on a scene of a disturbance on May 6, 2016, at which RJ Williams, 23, produced a pistol when ordered to show his hands.









Police received a call from Williams’s girlfriend, who reported Williams threatened to kill himself with a knife. After discovering police were enroute, Williams retrieved an unloaded handgun from his car, and announced he would lure the officer into shooting him.

Williams’ girlfriend called 911 again to report Williams had an unloaded gun. That information, though, was not conveyed to officer Mader or the two other arriving officers, according to Mader’s attorney, Timothy O’Brien.

Now Mader has filed a lawsuit that alleges:

“[The city] in a flawed effort to buttress the other officer’s use of deadly force, wrongfully terminated Mr Mader’s employment. When that termination came to light in the local press, the city then engaged in a pattern of retaliation designed to destroy Mr Mader’s reputation.”

According to the suit, officer Mader drew his weapon, at which point RJ Williams screamed:

“Just shoot me!”









Mader reportedly said:

“I don’t wanna shoot you, brother, just put down the gun.”

Mader then recalled:

“About that time two more cruisers arrived. At this point he starts to wave his gun at me and the other officers, and within seconds of the other officers getting out of their cruisers there were four shots fired.”

Investigators later discovered Williams’ gun was unloaded.

Mader’s superiors argued in their termination letter that Mader failed to respond to the threat.

It said:

“The unfortunate reality of police work is that making any decision is better than making no decision at all.”

But Mader made a decision–not to shoot Williams. He based this decision on Williams’ body language and evident mental state. Mader determined Williams did not present a threat and that de-escalation was the technique he could use.

About his decision, Mader, an Afghanistan veteran, said:

“He wasn’t angry, he wasn’t aggressive, he didn’t seem in position to want to use a gun against anybody. He never pointed it at me. I didn’t perceive him as an imminent threat.”

However, Mader’s termination letter states:

“No officer was ever trained to deduce the intention of a suspect.”

Of Mader’s termination, Joseph Cohen of the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia, said:

“Essentially they fired [Mader] for respecting RJ Williams’ constitutional rights.”

Mader’s attorney, Tim O’Brien, contends:

“When a police [officer] exercises restraint – and sometimes we don’t see that as much as we like to – that’s something that should be praised rather than punished.”

O’Brien told the Washington Post:

“It’s more ironic that we had many instances where an officer uses deadly force and nothing happens to them. Here, we have an officer who uses restraint and he gets punished. Odd would be an understatement.”

According to police department officials’ reports to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Mader’s decision to spare Williams was “not a primary factor in his termination,” citing two other incidents in which Mader was involved.

However, the Williams shooting letter contradicts this statement. It says:

“[Mader] should be dismissed from employment…due to to negligence on his part during the incident that occurred on 6 May 2016, in which a fellow officer had to react and unfortunately take the life of the suspect.”

Since his firing, officials have claimed Mader “froze” during the incident, and have labeled him a “disgruntled employee,” a “bad cop.”

Mader is seeking damages in excess of $75,000.

Betsy DeVos, President Donald Trump’s completely unqualified Education Secretary, faced a tough crowd today. DeVos was invited to speak at the graduation ceremony for Bethune-Cookman University, an historically black university (HBCU) in Daytona Beach, FL. She was met with a chorus of boos as she tried to speak, prompting an attempted intervention from university president Edison Jackson and at least one student being escorted from the premises, according to CNN.









The crowd started getting loud almost as soon as DeVos was announced. Students stood and turned their back on her when she stepped up to the lectern. She spoke for a bit to some random jeering, but this remark is what really set the crowd off:

“One of the hallmarks of higher education, and of democracy, is the ability to converse with and learn from those with whom we disagree.”

She should probably have that discussion with the man who put her in power.









The crowd ripped into her for the remark, prompting Jackson to step up to the microphone with a threat:

“If this behavior continues, your degrees will be mailed to you. Choose which way you want to go.”

For the most part, the raucous crowd settled for most of DeVos’ speech, which was supposed to run for an hour but wrapped after about twenty minutes. There were still boos throughout, and one student, a sophomore, was escorted out by security.

Students had been voicing concerns for weeks after DeVos was announced as a graduation speaker, and that she would be receiving an honorary doctorate from the university. In February, DeVos infamously made this statement about HBCUs to defend her stance on championing school vouchers:

“[HBCUs] are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and great quality. Their success has shown that more options help students flourish.”

The small flaw in this remark is that HBCUs were not just an option for black students – they were often the only option due to segregation and admission standards. This is not the only clueless remark DeVos has made about education in her short time in the spotlight with Team Trump.

DeVos is a huge proponent of charter schools and voucher programs – two programs that tend to fail. Watch the graduates of Bethune-Cookman University vocalize how they feel about her below:

"‘White Privilege’ is a term that comes up often in regards to social justice, and therefore politics. Reading the different comments out there reveals that many people don’t understand what white privilege refers to.









Consequently, those same people don’t understand the arguments against it (mostly by people of color) want from their society, their government.

Put simply,

White privilege is being perceived in a way that leads to better treatment from society. This does not necessarily include handouts) White privilege benefits white-looking people (perception is everything). This is true regardless of whether or not they are actually white, or how they feel about themselves or other races. Opponents of white privilege are not interested in demonizing white people, or free handouts, or reparations. They want equality of opportunity.

Otherwise: Buckle up, it’s a long read.

What White Privilege Isn’t:

White privilege is not automatic success. It doesn’t mean that if you are born white, someone slaps a million dollars in your hand. It doesn’t mean that a white person gets automatically shipped off to the most state-of-the-art home, school, or handed an internship.

White privilege grants neither fame, nor a ticket that entitles the holder be worshiped by others.

What White Privilege Is:

White privilege is less about what one receives for being white, and more about what they avoid because they are white. White privilege means people judge your character and qualifications, not your race, in most encounters. It means police and store personnel don’t assume that you’ve committed a crime or that you’re going to steal. It means people don’t perceive you as hostile. Therefore, in the case of law enforcement, they are less likely to jump to the use of force.

When you ARE treated unfairly, the question is rarely, if ever, ‘what did you do to bring it on?’ aka, victim blaming.

From the blog post found on ACLU of Northern California, note the section:

“Before last week, this discriminatory regulation excluded sex workers, sending a terrible message to victims of rape as well as perpetrators of sexual violence – that some survivors of sexual violence are to blame. It was an endorsement of the antiquated notion that victims deserve to be raped – she wanted it because she wore that mini skirt, or that she deserved it because she got that drunk, or that it was inevitable because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time.”









It’s easy to replace excuses like those mentioned above with ones like ‘he deserved it because he was wearing a hoodie.’ White privilege, however, removes all of that. Instead, people are actually concerned for your well-being first and foremost.

White privilege means that people tend to jump through hoops to AVOID seeing you as a bad person, even if doing questionable things, like carrying an assault rifle in public, or trying to cut through the lock mechanism of a bike that does not belong to you.

White privilege means that people take your qualifications at face value rather than factoring in inconsequential details. You voice and/or your name doesn’t exclude you from housing, employment, or loans.

White privilege means that your mistakes are honest mistakes, rather than damning, as they are for other people. It means that your mistakes are also your mistakes (lone wolf mentality) rather than representative of your entire race (thugs, superpredators, terrorists, etc). Conversely, your triumphs and your strengths represent your race, while the strengths of minorities are ‘flukes’ or ‘getting lucky.’ Even if people begrudgingly admit that a person of color is intelligent or strong, they do so as isolated incidents; such people of color are merely exceptions among their race (look at Serena Williams).

What Does This Mean?

Many people hold these views subconsciously. This is due largely in part to stereotypes. In effect, it has to do with the way people view certain people who happen to be pale. The benefits of white privilege have nothing to do with the receiver’s attitude or actions, and everything to do how others see them.

This means that:

It is possible to benefit from white privilege without being racist (or even white, for that matter), and Reasonable people of color are NOT attacking white people for this benefit, but are attacking the perception itself.

Combating white privilege is not about making white people feel guilty, or ashamed, or resentful of their heritage. It’s not about receiving free handouts for anybody. In reality, it’s about receiving the benefit of the doubt and equal opportunity.

People aren’t asking for success without hard work, but for their hard work to give them a fair shot at success.

Watch this social experiment – what would you do?

There has been much speculation since the 2016 election about Hillary Clinton’s next steps. Will she speak out against the Trump Administration’s destructive policies? She warned us plenty while on the campaign trail. Will she decide to run for an office again? Supporters want to see her push on and do something great.









The Hill’s Amie Parnes and Sidewire’s Jonathan Allen have written a new book titled “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign.” It was recorded on the night of the election that Chief Strategist, Jake Sullivan, pressed her saying:

“Everything you said, we’re going to do in the speech.”

“But you have been saying for many months that he’s temperamentally unfit and that he would be dangerous, and if you meant it, you should say it.”

“And you made a case that all these people’s rights and safety are in danger— if you meant that, you should say it.”









Clinton responded that it was not her job to do that. She said:

“Other people will criticize him. That’s their job. I have done it. I just lost, and that is that.”

“That was my last race.”

Her comments may come off as bitter, angry, or maybe indifferent, but understandably so. As all the election results finally came in, we realized that Clinton did more than just win the popular vote. She won it by 2.9 million votes! The American people spoke and clearly wanted her to be our president, and she wanted the job.

A few days after the election, she also admitted:

“This is painful and it will be for a long time.”

Clinton has encouraged everyone to get involved in our democracy and have a voice about what matters. At least for now, she has indicated that she will be more involved with The Clinton Foundation and her speaking engagements. She also wants to focus on spending time with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, and enjoy her two young grandchildren.

I don’t think she is gone, and I predict that she will use her strengths and expertise to help young women to rise in important positions in our government, and make our country a much better place.

Enjoy this video of Clinton’s story:

If its Monday and the internet is still operational, then you can bet that the pretend president will be posting all kinds of ridiculous nonsense on Twitter.









And true to form, Trump went on Twitter just after eight this morning and here’s one of several tweets he sent out:

A great book for your reading enjoyment: ""REASONS TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS"" by Michael J. Knowles. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2017

If you go to Amazon and look at the book being suggested by Trump, you soon notice it has 260 blank pages. How original! Of course, Trump loves books with no words because he’s not very bright and has the attention span of a hummingbird on meth.

It only took a few minutes for the Twitterverse to get even with the so-called head of state in absolutely hilarious ways:

@realDonaldTrump How about a few quotes from ""The Art of the Deal"" instead … pic.twitter.com/gXE9kgCivr — Rob Szczerba (@RJSzczerba) April 17, 2017

Some of the postings in response to Trump employ images to prove just how clueless the illegitimate POTUS is:

SPOILER ALERT: This article contains references to both the book and film titled 1984.

As technology becomes more ubiquitous, and surveillance (both from government and private institutions) becomes more prevalent, George Orwell’s novel 1984 is coming much closer to being a fortune teller than a work of fiction. Now, with President Donald Trump’s White House at war with the press and cooking up their own version of “alternative facts,” it seems as if the world of Orwell’s novel is here.









Over 180 theaters across the United States (and a few in other countries, such as Canada, Sweden, and Britain), will be showing the film version of 1984 on April 4 to serve as commentary on our current political climate.

A statement from the United State of Cinema, the group putting the event together, reads:

“Orwell’s portrait of a government that manufactures their own facts, demands total obedience, and demonizes foreign enemies, has never been timelier. The endeavor encourages theaters to take a stand for our most basic values: freedom of speech, respect for our fellow human beings, and the simple truth that there are no such things as ‘alternative facts.’ By doing what they do best – showing a movie – the goal is that cinemas can initiate a much-needed community conversation at a time when the existence of facts, and basic human rights are under attack. Through nationwide participation and strength in numbers, these screenings are intended to galvanize people at the crossroads of cinema and community, and bring us together to foster communication and resistance against current efforts to undermine the most basic tenets of our society.”

The book 1984 tells the story of Winston Smith (played by John Hurt in the film), a government worker under a totalitarian regime. Winston’s job is to go back through old newspaper articles and rewrite the information therein. This ensures that Big Brother, the figurehead leader of “The Party,” is always correct. As Winston becomes more jaded with the world he lives in, he begins keeping a diary, where he chronicles the tiny ways he is able to resist Big Brother.

The day Winston begins his journal is April 4, the same date of the film screenings.









Both the book and the film 1984 are works of fiction, but Orwell also intended it as a warning for how easily a society can slip into fascist control. Those “alternative facts” of the Trump regime are just regular “facts” to a lot of ignorant people.

In some good news, a push for less discrimination and equality for the LGBTQ has had a win in Oregon. The Governor Kate Brown of Oregon signed a Transgender equality bill and has said the government has no place in “…Dictating personal identity.”

The bill, HB 2673, has been put in place to make it easier for Transgender people who wish to amend their birth certificates and other identity certificates so they state the same gender they identify with.









This is a matter that many non-transgender people might not consider as a difficulty that accompanies being transgender. Imagine feeling you were born in the wrong body and the discrimination that comes with it. Then imagine a situation where you are asked to prove your identity and the only document you can produce does not reflect who you are. It might even add ammunition to the people who may be discriminating against you. This new bill allows transgender people the dignity and ability to attain papers that are aligned with who they are much more easily.









Transgender people are discriminated against in many ways, in the workplace, socially, and they are even murdered at higher rates. This is unacceptable and any bill that pushes for the protection of this community, is a compassionate and worthy one. With this bill and thanks to Gov. Kate Brown, Transgender people can now apply for their amended identification documents in a more affordable and simpler way.

JoDee Winterhof of Human Rights Campaign(HRC) reacted with this statement:

‘By signing this legislation into law, Governor Kate Brown is helping to make Oregon an even more inviting and inclusive place for transgender people to call home. We congratulate Basic Rights Oregon on this important victory and thank Governor Brown for her continued outstanding leadership on LGBTQ equality.’

In a tweet the Governor herself said this:

At a time where the White House is moving to take away protections from the Transgender community, this is welcome, good news.

It is also evidence that progressive policies can be achieved at local levels.

It is so refreshing to hear some good news! North Carolina’s relatively new Governor, Democrat Roy Cooper, is showing he is not a fan of discrimination and that he believes protection laws for the LGBTQ community are necessary. In repealing and replacing HB2 he has also promised that he will bring in an Executive Order to make sure LGBTQ people are protected properly.









While Obama’s bathroom protection for the trans community has been repealed by the new Republican Government federally, progressive Governor Cooper has restored faith to many in the LGBTQ community with these comments:

“My goal is statewide LGBT protections in North Carolina, and I’m going to keep fighting every day until I get to that point, … It would have been politically and probably emotionally easier for me to keep pounding the table and not accept a compromise but I knew it wasn’t right.”

His stance has brought criticism from all sides of politics, with both LGBTQ groups and conservatives not liking his compromise. To those concerned, he has since attempted to reassure with this:

“I said when we repealed HB2 and initiated the compromise, we needed to take additional steps to make sure we protect LGBT resident. We’re working on an executive order that will help further those goals.”









In the press conference Cooper made these comments about the repeal of the existing bill:

“We are a welcoming state, House Bill two was not. Our people are welcoming, House Bill two was not. But today our laws are catching up with our people…. It’s about working to end discrimination.”

It is heart-warming to hear these words. We are living in crazy times and while Washington Republicans are set on sending us back to the Dark Ages, it is a relief to hear there are some people in power, who have their hearts in the right place.

Discrimination has no place in modern society. All citizens deserve equal respect and opportunity. We look forward to reading the Executive Order he has promised.

Californian special needs teacher, Michael Stack from San Luis Obispo High School has resigned from his position. He chose to leave after the response to a letter he wrote to the Editor of his school’s campus newspaper. In that letter he quoted part of the Bible, as it pertained to how he felt about homosexuality. He wrote:









“I love the staff and students at SLOHS. My students know that. But I love God more, so in obedience to Him, I am writing this letter. I’m a teacher, and I don’t want to displease God any more than I already have with my sinful life, so in obedience to Him, I’m asking you to please slowly read and consider the following excerpt from the book of Romans.”

He then quoted a part of the Old Testament which says that homosexuality is not natural and that:

“God’s justice requires that those who do these things deserve to die.””

The letter then goes on about how people have abandoned God and what he wants from us. He continued:

“So God abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and shameful things with each other’s bodies. They traded the truth about God for a lie. So they worshiped and served the things God created instead of the creator Himself, who is worthy of eternal praise! Amen. That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other. And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this sin, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved. “









He has since said that he was merely exercising his first amendment rights and when others responded to his letter, that they were doing the same. However then he posted the following online:

“…The community apparently wants me out, so I hereby grant them their desires.”

Michael Stack has, like so many others, used religion in an attempt to shame people and who they are, in this case homosexuality. When people are young and still establishing who they are, a letter like Stack’s could be devastating for them. Federal law, thanks to former President Barack Obama, now recognizes marriage equality. (More after the jump.)

This was a huge step for the acceptance of homosexuality in society.

Letters such as Stack’s show that some people still have a long road to travel, until society reaches full acceptance.

The religious right would have you believe that it’s only trying to give socially conservative Americans a place at the table. However, this is a sham. Whenever they think they’re in unguarded moments, their true extremism comes out. They don’t want you to know that, though. Whenever they actually get called on it, they scream and wail that those calling them out are the real bigots.









We got a lovely example of this from the leader of a very exclusive club–social conservatives in Massachusetts. Brian Camenker of MassResistance is none too happy that the Southern Poverty Law Center has branded his group a hate group since 2008.

Camenker accuses the SPLC of engaging in a campaign of “demonization and disinformation” against groups and individuals that espouse “conservative and Judeo-Christian values.” In the process, Camenker claims that the SPLC glosses over “actual hate groups” on the left.

Who are these odious groups? Black Lives Matter, for one; Camenker claims it has “advocated murdering police.” Never mind that BLM has unequivocally condemned violence against police. He also repeats the right-wing shibboleth that Floyd Lee Corkins’ shooting spree at the headquarters of the Family Research Council in 2012 was triggered by SPLC branding it a hate group. He forgets that the shooting was roundly condemned by the LGBT community.









A closer look at MassResistance’s work reveals that Camenker’s online tirade is classic deflection. For instance, take this pearl-clutching video MassResistance put together of the 2016 Massachusetts Youth Pride rally.

All the ominous music can’t change the fact that this march was peaceful, and the kids on the streets were acting perfectly normally. In other words–classic agitprop.

But the most damning evidence of all comes from 2015, when Camenker appeared on American Family Radio alongside morning drive-time host Sandy Rios. Camenker justified bans on same-sex marriage by arguing that bans on interracial marriage were constitutional. Any group who would even try to find a way to defend one of the greatest evils of the Jim Crow era is a hate group. Period, full stop.

All things considered, it sounds like Camenker just can’t handle having the hot lights turned on him.

In a world that seems to be heading more and more backwards every day, Missouri Republican Rick Brattin has accelerated while in reverse. According to the Kansas City Star he actually made this statement:

“When you look at the tenets of religion, of the Bible, of the Qur’an, of other religions, there is a distinction between homosexuality and just being a human being.”









He made the shocking assertion on Monday at the Missouri House of Representatives while arguing against an amendment to a discrimination bill. He is actually on the side of making it easier to discriminate against gay people and it seems he thinks he can use holy books to back up his crazy outlook.

Does Brattin know we do not live in a theocracy? Is he aware that the Bible and Qur’an are actually separate to state? It is for this exact reason that the constitution was written to be secular and exclude any tyranny of religion.









This is not the law makers first brush with controversy. Years ago he was involved in the use of the term ‘legitimate rape.’ At the time he was arguing that women could only access an abortion pill if they could prove ‘legitimate rape.’ This caused a storm at the time. Brattin is on video saying that with regard to abortion, he believed women’s rights had swung so far over:

“that we’ve now taken away the man’s rights.”

It is incredible that this man has power and he uses his power to say that women and gay people are afforded too many rights. If Brattin really thinks there is a distinction between homosexuality and just being a human being, I would love to know what it is.

Shakespeare once addressed a group of people not being considered ‘human’ in The Merchant of Venice, when Shylock most beautifully says:

“If you prick us, do we not bleed?

If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

If you poison us, do we not die?

and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?”

"In a shocking plot, four men aged between 18 and 21 have been charged with conspiring to cause bodily injury to people based on their sexual orientation. The crimes occurred in late January – early February 2017, in Plano, Frisco, and Aubrey. The men have since been charged with a federal hate crime, which could mean life in prison.









These men pretended to be gay on the dating app Grindr to find victims. Then, under this pretense, they gained access to their victim’s homes. Once inside they proceeded to threaten their victims with guns and robbed them.









The accused men are Anthony Shelton, 19; Nigel Garrett, 21; Chancler Encalade, 20; and Cameron Ajiduah, 18 and if found guilty, it is certainly a crime that could be punished with the full force of the law. These men tied up and assaulted their victims, stole their property, including cars, and made homophobic slurs during the attacks.

Jeanne Rubin, the president of the North Texas Gay and Lesbian Alliance President was glad the assaults and robberies have been classed as hate crimes and said:

“You can be scared as a homeowner if your neighbor is robbed, but it’s different if you feel like you’re being targeted for some reason and in this case a whole community can feel like they’re targeted.”

It begs the question, how can people have such hate in their heart to do such a thing? It is hard to believe that there are people in society who could stoop so low as this. The most haunting thing about this crime is how calculated and premeditated it was. The fact that they could pretend to be gay online for the purpose of violent robberies is a terrible low.

Obama’s recognition of same sex marriage was such a step forward for the entire community, a step towards equality. Then when hate crimes targeting a vulnerable community can still happen, it is one giant step back.

Mark Green, a state senator from Tennessee, has withdrawn his name from the nomination as Secretary of the Army. He was President Donald Trump’s second pick for the position, as Florida Panthers owner Vincent Viola withdrew his name as well. Viola cited business conflicts of interest as his reason for withdrawing. Green cites an all too familiar, and downright disturbing, reason: the left is “mischaracterizing” and “attacking” past comments he made demonizing various groups, specifically the LGBT community.









In a statement announcing his withdrawal, Green had this to say:

“… Due to false and misleading attacks against me, this nomination has become a distraction. Tragically, my life of public service and my Christian beliefs have been mischaracterized and attacked by a few on the other side of the aisle for political gain. While these false attacks have no bearing on the needs of the Army or my qualifications to serve, I believe it is critical to give the President the ability to move forward with his vision to restore our military to its rightful place in the world.”

Tragic, isn’t it? Read his full statement here:

JUST IN: President Trump's pick for Army Secretary, Mark Green, withdraws his nomination pic.twitter.com/9dLo77iqro — NBC News (@NBCNews) May 5, 2017

GLAAD unearthed just one of the damning “mischaracterized” past comments Green had made, where he seems to compare transgendered people using the bathroom to members of ISIS disguising themselves as refugees:









“The government exists to honor those people who live honorable who do good things – to reward people who behave well and to crush evil. So that means as a state senator, my responsibility very clearly in Romans 13 is to create an environment where people who do right are rewards and the people who do wrong are crushed. Evil is crushed. So I’m going to protect women in their bathrooms, and I’m going to protect our state against potential infiltration from the Syrian ISIS people in the refugee program. And whoever wants to stand up and take me on that, I’m ready to fight.”

Thankfully, Tennessee’s bathroom bill failed to pass. It appears Trump is still suffering from a problem that his plagued him since being elected: his picks for various positions are unfit or don’t want (and usually a combination of both) the jobs he offers.

Kim Davis has been in the spotlight for years now. She is famous of course for being a Christian ‘martyr’ who put her religious beliefs above the law. She took it upon herself to deny gay couples marriage licenses and one of those couples is once again suing her for doing so.









Davis is back in the headlines because gay couple, Ermold and Moore, have won their appeal to sue her for damages caused by her denial to approve a marriage licence. Their attorney Michael Gartland has said this of the case:

“We’re going to get damages, I’m sure of that. There’s been no discovery yet. I can’t imagine it’s a huge amount of damages, but there are damages.”

While Davis and others would obviously like to live in a country with no separation of church and state, guess what? that is not how this place works – and for good reason! All we have to do is put ourselves in the shoes of others to understand.

How would Kim Davis like a religion that discriminates against her being accepted as above the law or even by Mick Huckabee (who has supported her right to discriminate against gay people in this way)?









This Twitter account is happy about the latest developments:

And I don't think she's going to get full price back for those jet skis she bought with that huckabee money. https://t.co/KlYGtiauhx — Sitnexto Kim Davis (@nexttokimdavis) May 4, 2017

Now Davis is allowed to believe whatever she likes, however a huge problem arose here because she was in a special position of power. By refusing to do her job – and that was to issue marriage licences, she not only cruelly discriminated against gay couples, she was also breaking the law.

The controversy surrounding her is an interesting one. She believes God disapproves of gay marriage and thinks that entitles her to break the law. Well let’s extend that thinking, imagine if religious ‘belief’ could override all laws – what would society then become?

That’s right; it would make us a theocracy and that is just not America – thank goodness!

Julia Roberts has backed Miguel Johnson from Missouri in a stand against Trump’s anti-trans laws. Roberts met Miguel at the GLSEN (Gay, Lesbian, & Straight Education Network) awards in 2016. Roberts has said:

“I had the pleasure of presenting with Miguel at the GLSEN Respect Awards, and Miguel, like all the students I meet there, is smart, kind and incredibly brave to live their life openly and honestly as [sic] such a young age.”









Roberts explains why she is backing Johnson:

“As a parent, I want all students to feel safe and protected at school, and I stand with Miguel and trans students across the country. You are loved.”

Roberts also calls Trump out for his phony campaign promises:

“Before Trump got elected, he always said he was totally for LGBTQ students, because they’re people too and they deserve an education. And then after he got elected, he was basically like, ‘Just kidding, I lied.’”

Trump of course rescinded the bathroom protective laws brought in by Obama, leaving the transgender community vulnerable in that they are now forced to use a bathroom they feel uncomfortable in or that might not match their physical appearance.









Roberts is supporting Johnson’s protest against the Trump administration. Johnson has said:

“The more voices, the more heard. We need to be progressive. People don’t realize that these things affect people they know and care about. So I’m hoping that the more people come out and speak up, the more people will start realize this affects them too.”

It is vital that we stand up for the rights of the vulnerable in society. We need to defend and build a liberal and kind society that respects all people and their rights as human beings. The transgender community needs to be embraced and made to feel safe, not terrified of bullying and discrimination.

Just because people do not understand an issue, should not mean intolerance. We need to speak about these issues openly to progress and Pretty Woman star Julia Roberts is doing just that by standing by Miguel Johnson.

Every once in awhile, the religious right turns its five-inch guns on a product that supposedly isn’t espousing good “family values.” The latest to fall within the crosshairs of the nation’s so-called moral guardians is Unilever’s Dove personal care line. Apparently they aren’t too keen on an ad that includes a cross-dressing mom.









Dove’s line of baby care products, Baby Dove, recently launched a campaign called “#RealMoms.” The idea behind it is simple–there’s no perfect way to be a mom. All that really counts is if you’re willing to give your child all of your love. The first ad in the campaign rolled out in early April; watch it here.

One mom featured in the ad is raising her baby on a cattle ranch. Another lets her baby watch her practice her break dancing skills. But most of the attention is focused on the third mom in the ad, Shea, a grad student who recently had a son. As it turns out, Shea is a man who cross-dresses as a woman, and identifies both himself and his wife as his son’s mothers.

That doesn’t sit well with One Million Moms, a long-running campaign of the American Family Association that seeks to organize Christian moms and grandmothers to combat the supposedly unwholesome messages directed at kids. Campaign director Monica Cole told OneNewsNow, the in-house online news arm of AFA, that Dove was being “absurd” in pushing an ad that risked “offending its target market.”

However, One Million Moms’ pearl-clutching appeal to its followers about this ad can only be described as absurd. Consider this paragraph.

“‘Shea’ inarguably has a sex. He is objectively and immutably a man. The lowest-bar requirement for mothers is that they are objectively female. The essential feature of mothers is their objective sex as females. Whatever else a mother is, she is first and necessarily a woman. This man is not, and never can be a woman, and, therefore, he is not, and never can be a mother.”

Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! There is a minimum requirement to be a mother–but it has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with the heart. A mother has to be willing to give all of her love to her children. Period, full stop. Regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, that is the only thing that should matter.









I’ve met my fair share of moms who supposedly meet One Millon Moms’ “lowest-bar requirement”–and yet, they are manifestly unfit by any standard to be mothers. My ex-wife is a textbook example. This was a woman who hit her own son in the head out of anger when he was a baby, and couldn’t be bothered to file a response when her husband filed an affidavit about the incident.

One Million Moms goes on to say that Shea has “in effect abandoned his son” by choosing to live as a woman, since his son won’t have a male role model. This is a recycled version of an argument the religious right has used for years against allowing LGBT people to adopt. However, there is no credible study showing that kids raised in LGBT households turn out any worse than kids raised in straight households.

On the contrary, nearly all credible studies show that children aren’t at any disadvantage if they’re raised in an LGBT home. The one study that purported to prove that kids raised in LGBT households didn’t turn out well was conducted by University of Texas sociology professor Mark Regnerus, and has been exposed as so fatally flawed that it shouldn’t be used to make policy.

As long as Shea’s son receives the love and nurturing he needs, it shouldn’t matter whether he has two mothers. Let One Million Moms know what you think of their tone-deaf line on their Facebook page. Their Twitter feed seems to have been inactive for a month, but let them have it there as well. Be sure to let Dove know we’ve got their back on Facebook and on their Website as well.

Texas Republican Randy Weber has given a prayer that turned into a plea for forgiveness from God for the ‘sins’ of this nation. Speaking at the A Man of Prayer event in Washington, Weber began with the Lord’s prayer and then asked for God’s forgiveness for many things including the separation of church and state in schools. He offered an apology to God for having drug-sniffing dogs at school instead of the ten commandments.









Of same sex marriage laws Weber says with emotion:

“Father, we’ve trampled on your holy institution of holy matrimony and tried to rewrite what it is and we’ve called it an alternate lifestyle… father, oh father, please forgive us.”

His tears here are questionable. He then moves on to abortion:

“Lord we have gone to kill the most innocent among us… we are killing our descendants and we’re calling it a choice.”

Weber’s rant about modern America and even goes as far to call the country’s debt a sin.

Randy Weber obviously does not want same sex marriage. He feels it contradicts the bible. That is his belief and his choice.

However, there are gay people in this world, some happen to be Christian and some non-Christian people. These citizens are naturally attracted to the same gender as their own. These people have every right to be an equal part of our society and that includes marriage. It is a matter of equality.









The fact that Weber would cry over the fact that a group in society have been given equal rights is sickening and the opposite of the compassion that Jesus Christ himself was famous for.

Weber is also anti abortion and cries about it. Well imagine the tears of the countless women who face this scenario for a wide range of reasons. This is not a black and white issue. This is about the importance of giving women who have found themselves in a pregnancy that could cause great psychological or physical harm a real choice about what happens to their bodies.

Weber wants the church to be back in schools. How about giving all school children, who are still developing, the ability to think critically, so that when they are fully grown they can make a rational decision about belief. Surely this is preferable to an indoctrinated view from a very young age.

Weber’s attempt to appear emotional about these issues makes his comments even more despicable. His version of his faith is one thing, equality within society is quite another.

I write a Christian left blog. The site I write for is a far left, radically liberal site called Liberal America. It focuses especially on issues of the marginalized, poverty, corporate greed, bigotry, discrimination, and hypocrisy. It supports itself with Google ads, which often include ads for dating websites, Viagra, and other non-workplace-appropriate elements. Clicking on a link to one of my blogs often pulls up some pretty disgusting ads, and I am told that I should write for Pathos, or Christianity Today, or some other “more appropriate” site or publication.

But I don’t. And I won’t.









I didn’t do any of this on purpose. A friend who owns the site contacted me and asked me to be the Christian voice on their extremely non-religious site. I had no idea what I was agreeing to, as my first few postings were basically shortened sermons and didn’t get much of a response except for people who read Liberal America commenting that I was an idiot, and that I believed in a sky fairy. Then one day as I sat in front of my computer watching my Christian friends post hateful things about gun control after yet another college shooting, and then more hateful things about the LGBTQ community over legalized gay marriage, I became angry and wrote a blog entry. The internet went crazy with it and within two hours, I was the “Pissed Off Southern Pastor.” I had to shut down my personal Facebook page for a week because people were requesting to friend me, and sending me inbox messages, at a rate of literally one hundred an hour.

In the next few days, I reactivated my Facebook page, did a lot of praying, and discovered a world of “nones and dones” who were desperate for a religious leader to say some of the things I had said. I began to work my way through hundreds of messages and emails from people who had been moved by what I had said. Apparently, there were a lot of people who were pissed off, and they were relieved to have a religious spokesperson who had said publicly what they had been afraid to say themselves.









In the last 18 months since the “Pissed Off” article ran, I have posted ninety-two blogs, and I have been called out on them numerous times by others in the church who believe that I shouldn’t write what I write or where I write it. On the Liberal America page itself, I get called horrible names and made fun of by agnostics and atheists who think I am a joke. But the best part is what no one else sees. I didn’t intend to become an advocate for the LGBTQ community. I was outspoken in the original article about all kinds of radically unloving things, not just discrimination and attacks on the LGBTQ community, but that group of people reached out to me in ways I never expected.

Today, I pray with transgender people in France, lesbian couples in Belgium, and gay men in Texas. I have chatted with lesbian couples as they shopped in Barnes and Noble for the first Bible either of them had held in 20 years. I direct people to the Reconciling Ministries Network, so that they can find a church home where they will be loved and accepted. I message with teenagers trying to find the courage to come out, and with elderly people who regret that they never did. These are people who desired a relationship with the church but felt unwanted and even condemned. Just hearing a pastor get publicly mad about the fact that they were being made to feel that way by much of the Christian world was all they needed to reach out.

Colossians 3:12-15

12 As God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. 13 Bear with one another and, if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive each other; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. 14 Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. 15 And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful.

I am no longer devastated by any backlash which might come from my writing, and when I am told that I should “rethink my relationship with that website,” I explain that Jesus didn’t open the doors of a building and say, “come inside;” he went to where the people were.

Luke 19:10

10 For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.”

People who have been left out or hurt by the church read websites which agree with them about the damage the church can do, so that is where I choose to write. I don’t mind the names I get called on the page itself, because I know the messages I receive in private are what counts.

There are many progressively thinking clergy in rural southern America, but when we were at a conference, and the Reconciling Ministries Network was passing out rainbow buttons which read “Y’all Means All,” several took the buttons, but put them in their pockets for fear of people seeing them and that being an obstacle in their appointments. As I sat that day and pondered it, I took my button out and put it proudly on. Either I am going to live my calling, or it isn’t real. It was four months after that when I wrote the Southern Pastor article which forced me to live into that fully.

When I am in the pulpit, I preach the Gospel. I don’t discuss politics, and if the Gospel upsets your politics, then that is between you and God. I am only trying to preach what Jesus taught. Then several times a week, I try to set aside time to manage the page I created on Facebook, and answer the ever-growing number of messages which I receive as a result. And therein lies the problem.

I only find the time once or twice a week to check in on my page and messages. And I only find time to write something new once or twice a month, sometimes not even that much. People need pastoral care and inspiration; they are facing life’s problems and issues in which they need to know they are not alone. They are searching for support and guidance through sanctifying grace all the time. As an appointed part-time pastor, in seminary full-time, and working a part-time secular job to be able to pay the bills, I simply do not have the time to be in ministry in this obviously, massive, mission field. But there is an answer.

We, as the church, must begin to view and approach ministry in its current context, and stop attempting to fit 21st century ministry needs into 16th century ministry models. We can’t keep wondering why people are not coming to church on Sunday mornings, and yet keep pouring our funds into building more and bigger church buildings for Sunday morning attendance.

In Henri J. M. Nouwen’s book, A Spirituality of Fundraising, he beautifully explains the idea of creating space in which to discuss a real need for financial stewardship and a concise understanding of how money and ministry are really one. Nouwen explains that we must stop equating money with power and thinking that funding something in any way takes away existing power in the church. By withholding financial support from newer and more relevant mission fields and approaches, the church hierarchy isn’t holding power in the already existing church organizations; they are blocking the investment of many others who are unable to find a comfortable place to give in the existing structure. (pp. 29-31) People who have never experienced church, or who have been hurt by a previous church experience, or who simply don’t feel comfortable in the traditional church building setting, can be brought into fellowship with the larger church organization by offering them a place and a method which is more appropriate and comfortable to them. When they connect with the church as a whole, it doesn’t take away from the existing church hierarchy or structure, it simply brings even more gifts, talents, resources, and witness into the church as a whole. (pp. 36-41)

Christians want to reach the unchurched. They want to find the “nones and the dones” and speak to them about Jesus. They obviously want to, or we wouldn’t be able to raise billions of dollars a year to build more church buildings. What we have to do is break away from the idea that the unchurched will come to us if we have a big pretty door to open, and begin to realize that it is our job to go out and find the unchruched, and in many cases, minister to them right where they already are.

It seems the thinking is that subsidizing a coffee shop ministry, or an online ministry, or any other alternate setting, is a threat to the budget which is already stretched, and in some cases, failing. We must let go of this type of thinking. Spreading the gospel however, wherever, and whenever people need to hear it simply must become the focus. And for that to be the focus, we have to let go of the idea that a church only exists as long as a building does. Church is an idea, a belief, a commission, and a covenant, and Jesus never once said it required a building.

We do not look at the theology of sexuality to purposefully start some sort of argument. And I did not write about the LGBTQ community because I wanted to start some sort of revolution in the church. But if we are really trying to be a prophetic voice, it is our job to continually be delving deeper, and reinterpreting in original and relevant ways, or we are just repeating the missions, needs, and ministries of a bunch of German philosophers from centuries ago. While it would certainly be difficult to take attendance and keep records the way we are accustomed to, reaching the people must take precedence over stockpiling numbers and maintaining the status quo.

Sometimes I still get told that I am a divisive element, and the church is concerned about my choice of writing. But any night when I have the time to answer the messages and emails from people I have never physically met, I am convinced that this is a new place of ministry which will become more and more relevant in the near future.

I am not sure of the answers, just that there are questions we should be asking, and it is our job as Christians to ask them. I am not afraid of what we might find by looking at the Bible in new and necessary ways; my faith is stronger than that. And I am not afraid of accepting that bigger and more opulent buildings may not be the future of the church. We cannot think in only old ways and expect to get new results. It is time to rethink and recommit the way the funding of the church is handled. It is absolutely imperative that we do. It is scary, but it is necessary.

I propose that less building projects be approved, and more non-building appointments be created. The money is already there; the question is will we be brave enough to use it in new ways to reach God’s people wherever and however they need to be reached.

Only through committed prayer and trusting cooperation can the church open its eyes to the future. We must fund online, on the street, and in the neighborhood appointments, and stop building structures, which not only are not attracting the “nones and dones” to God, but are a physical and lasting testimony to our lack of commitment to go out and seek those in need where they are in this wounded world.

Pastor John Gray has been given his own reality show called ‘The book of John Gray’ on the Oprah Winfrey Network. Gay star news reported the story calling Gray a ‘homophobic hate preacher.’ Pastor Gray openly opposed Obama’s ground breaking same-sex laws in 2012, tweeting this:









The Christian President of United States believes something different from the God he serves. Anyone else a little concerned? — John Gray (@RealJohnGray) May 9, 2012

Not only did this tweet question Obama’s faith, it fails to recognize this as a civil rights issue. In learning of the pastor’s new show on Oprah, Michael Schirmer recently replied with this tweet:

@RealJohnGray being gay is no more avoidable than being black. #LEARNIT, #Oprah WTF were you thinking?? — Michael Schirmer (@mschirmersf) April 19, 2017

Another contentious tweet from Gray’s past is this one:

homosexuality is no different from fornication, adultery, lying or any other sin God was clear about. It's all the same-4those who believe. — John Gray (@RealJohnGray) April 29, 2013









This tweet from Pastor Gray is quite troubling. To class homosexuality at the same moral level as cheating and lying is more than an insult. Loving another adult person is not a sin. Being attracted to who you naturally feel attracted is not a sin.

It is disappointing that so often ancient scriptures are taken literally, especially when times have changed. Even in the New Testament Jesus does not condemn homosexuality and his message was clearly to ‘love thy neighbor.’ Gray is not only offending homosexual people, in this statement he also lumps all ‘believers’ into one pot. Not all believers feel the same about homosexuality. Not all believers consider it a sin!

There Are Other Ways Of Interpreting The Scriptures.

Not everyone sees them the same way. For example the former Bishop John Shelby Spong, who is a Christian and ran an Anglican church in Virginia. He had gay ministers. Spong was not a literalist.

As a spiritual leader he embraced the gay community and not by ignoring what Jesus said, but by following his example, one of love.

Who is to say this interpretation is not the correct one?

Religion does not have to condemn homosexuality. For Pastor John Gray to view homosexuals as ‘wrong-doers’ sends a terrible message to both homosexual people and their friends and families. This is the kind of stigma we need to be getting rid of.

Many in the gay community are shocked to hear that a pastor with these views has been given a reality show on Oprah’s network.

Rather than call gay people ‘sinners,’ perhaps people of faith, such as John Gray, could actually speak to the gay community, show compassion and try to understand that sexuality is not a choice or a behavior that should be condemned by anyone.

Today, the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, upheld the lower court ruling that blocks President Donald Trump’s administration from temporarily suspending new visas for people from the primarily Muslim countries of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.









The Washington Post reported on Trump being handed another legal blow in his efforts to block the issuance of new visas to citizens of six Muslim majority countries.

An appeals court refused to reinstate Trump’s revised travel ban. The case will likely go to the Supreme Court. https://t.co/SpBZOPXN3s — The New York Times (@nytimes) May 25, 2017

Chief Circuit Judge Roger L. Gregory wrote in a majority opinion, joined in part by nine other judges:

“Congress granted the president broad power to deny entry to aliens, but that power is not absolute. It cannot go unchecked when, as here, the president wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation.”

The 4th Circuit declined to lift the Maryland federal judge’s original order, which ruled against the travel ban in March. Opponents of the ban assert that it violates the Constitution by intentionally singling out Muslims for discrimination. Today’s ruling leaves the injunction in place. This will allow citizens from Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Syria, and Yemen to continue to enter the United States.









The freeze on the travel ban would still have stayed in place even if the appeals court had sided with the Administration, Trump’s order is also being held because of a federal judge in Hawaii, whose opinion also is against the ban. The Justice Department appealed the Hawaii decision in oral arguments on May 15 at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

During oral arguments, the 4th Circuit judges expressed misgivings about the viability of Trump’s order. It has been questioned – and disproved – whether there is a link between barring of citizens from Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Syria, and Yemen actually ensures national security.

#BREAKING: Appeals court upholds lower court's block of Trump travel ban https://t.co/ZUOtIG3ZKT pic.twitter.com/HpoTzYwZnQ — The Hill (@thehill) May 25, 2017

The Justice Department does not want to address whether Trump’s order violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment in addition to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Crucial to this case is the issue of whether courts should consider Trump’s past statements about wanting to bar Muslims from entering the country. Some of the judges on the appeals court were skeptical about the use of past statements by Trump.

Trump, not being one to learn a lesson easily, will likely appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

This week, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos gave a speech at the American Federation for Children Summit 2017. She keeps talking about school choice, but she seems to be skimping on the details of how that will work.









She said:

“We must offer the widest number of quality options to every family and every child. We stand on the verge of the most significant opportunity we have ever had to drag American education out of the Stone Age and into the future.”

She said that the state of Indiana could serve as a model for what she wants to do, but, again, no details. She continued:

“If a state doesn’t want to participate, that would be a terrible mistake on their part. They will be hurting the children and families who can least afford it. If politicians in a state block education choice, it means those politicians do not support equal opportunity for all kids.”









Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee said:

“Once again, Secretary DeVos is putting her extreme privatization agenda ahead of our students. DeVos claims she wants to provide more choices for students and families, but in reality, voucher programs siphon taxpayer funds from public schools to unaccountable private and religious schools that often leave children worse off.”

This is not where we need our education system to be headed. We cannot be funding religious schools with taxpayer money. We should be using that money to be making our public schools better. Teachers should be paid a decent wage.

DeVos also doesn’t seem to be opposed to sending students to schools that discriminate. She said just yesterday:

“If a parent chooses to go to a school that is not a public school, then that is a decision made and a contract made with that provider.”

Do we really want our taxpayer money going to these kinds of schools?

President Donald Trump couldn’t have won without the xenophobic vote. Which makes his support of radical Islamic terrorism all the more interesting.









Radical Islam

Trump ran his campaign on making America first. Racists flocked to his rallies in droves, eager to see that white supremacy was finally being normalized.

He even said:

“Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”

Yet last month, the CIA quietly restored their Train and Equip program in Syria. While they claim it’s to support “moderate” Syrian rebels, it’s been proven there’s no such thing as a “moderate” rebel.









It’s all the Islamic State.

Former President Barack Obama originally did this program in an attempt to destabilize the Syrian government. Thanks to Trump’s love of Twitter, his 2013 tweet about staying out of Syria has been making the rounds:

We should stop talking, stay out of Syria and other countries that hate us, rebuild our own country and make it strong and great again-USA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2013

Four years and one amazing piece of chocolate cake later, and we’re knee deep in Syria.

ISIS

Trump built up and has maintained his voter base by fueling Islamophobia. In fact, hate crimes against Muslims have been on the rise since he was elected into office. It’s no secret that most of his supporters hated Obama because he was Black.

During the campaign last year, Trump even claimed that Obama was the founder of ISIS. Naturally that turned a few heads. He was later asked if he meant Obama created it inadvertently.

Trump replied:

“No, I meant he’s the founder of ISIS. I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.”

So it would seem as though Trump wants nothing to do with Islam. He would rather focus on Making America Great and White Again, to try and get a Muslim ban passed and to let Syria take care of itself.

Just when you thought Trump couldn’t be more hypocritical, he restarts the Train and Equip program to help radical Islamic terrorism.

Donald Trump made his long-anticipated speech on the subject of Islam in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, and not once did he use the phrase “Radical Islamic terrorism,” which he repeatedly criticized President Obama for not using. Apparently Republicans and other poorly educated morons think if you say those three words, terrorism will vanish from the face of the earth. Instead, Trump commented:

“This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it.”









On social media, lots of people noticed the absence of the three magic words, and some of them were Trump supporters:

Californian special needs teacher, Michael Stack from San Luis Obispo High School has resigned from his position. He chose to leave after the response to a letter he wrote to the Editor of his school’s campus newspaper. In that letter he quoted part of the Bible, as it pertained to how he felt about homosexuality. He wrote:









“I love the staff and students at SLOHS. My students know that. But I love God more, so in obedience to Him, I am writing this letter. I’m a teacher, and I don’t want to displease God any more than I already have with my sinful life, so in obedience to Him, I’m asking you to please slowly read and consider the following excerpt from the book of Romans.”

He then quoted a part of the Old Testament which says that homosexuality is not natural and that:

“God’s justice requires that those who do these things deserve to die.””

The letter then goes on about how people have abandoned God and what he wants from us. He continued:

“So God abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and shameful things with each other’s bodies. They traded the truth about God for a lie. So they worshiped and served the things God created instead of the creator Himself, who is worthy of eternal praise! Amen. That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other. And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this sin, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved. “









He has since said that he was merely exercising his first amendment rights and when others responded to his letter, that they were doing the same. However then he posted the following online:

“…The community apparently wants me out, so I hereby grant them their desires.”

Michael Stack has, like so many others, used religion in an attempt to shame people and who they are, in this case homosexuality. When people are young and still establishing who they are, a letter like Stack’s could be devastating for them. Federal law, thanks to former President Barack Obama, now recognizes marriage equality. (More after the jump.)

This was a huge step for the acceptance of homosexuality in society.

Letters such as Stack’s show that some people still have a long road to travel, until society reaches full acceptance.

English comedian Stephen Fry is being investigated for blasphemy under Ireland’s 2009 Defamation Act. The comedian and atheist described a hypothetical creator as an “utter maniac” and “stupid.”









Fry was asked in a 2015 interview what he would say to God if he died and went to the Pearly Gates. Fry said:

“I’d say, bone cancer in children? What’s that about?”

“How dare you? How dare you create a world to which there is such misery that is not our fault? It’s not right, it’s utterly, utterly evil.”

“Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world that is so full of injustice and pain?

“We have to spend our life on our knees thanking him? What kind of god would do that?”

“The god who created this universe, if it was created by god, is quite clearly a maniac, an utter maniac, totally selfish.”

The Irish police are refusing to comment on the alleged investigation. Under Irish laws, Fry could be charged up to $25,000 if convicted. The remarks, which were made two years ago, were reported by someone watching the show at the time.









The member of the public who reported it said:

“I told the Garda I wanted to report Fry for uttering blasphemy and RTE for publishing/broadcasting it and that I believed these were criminal offences under the Defamation Act 2009.”

“The garda then took a formal written statement from me in which I quoted Fry’s comments in detail. This written statement mentioned both Fry and RTÉ specifically.”

“I told the Garda that I did not want to include this as I had not personally been offended by Fry’s comments – I added that I simply believed that the comments made by Fry on RTÉ were criminal blasphemy and that I was doing my civic duty by reporting a crime.”

The fact that there are blasphemy laws anywhere in 2015 is ridiculous.

Here is a video of the interview:

Kim Davis has been in the spotlight for years now. She is famous of course for being a Christian ‘martyr’ who put her religious beliefs above the law. She took it upon herself to deny gay couples marriage licenses and one of those couples is once again suing her for doing so.









Davis is back in the headlines because gay couple, Ermold and Moore, have won their appeal to sue her for damages caused by her denial to approve a marriage licence. Their attorney Michael Gartland has said this of the case:

“We’re going to get damages, I’m sure of that. There’s been no discovery yet. I can’t imagine it’s a huge amount of damages, but there are damages.”

While Davis and others would obviously like to live in a country with no separation of church and state, guess what? that is not how this place works – and for good reason! All we have to do is put ourselves in the shoes of others to understand.

How would Kim Davis like a religion that discriminates against her being accepted as above the law or even by Mick Huckabee (who has supported her right to discriminate against gay people in this way)?









This Twitter account is happy about the latest developments:

And I don't think she's going to get full price back for those jet skis she bought with that huckabee money. https://t.co/KlYGtiauhx — Sitnexto Kim Davis (@nexttokimdavis) May 4, 2017

Now Davis is allowed to believe whatever she likes, however a huge problem arose here because she was in a special position of power. By refusing to do her job – and that was to issue marriage licences, she not only cruelly discriminated against gay couples, she was also breaking the law.

The controversy surrounding her is an interesting one. She believes God disapproves of gay marriage and thinks that entitles her to break the law. Well let’s extend that thinking, imagine if religious ‘belief’ could override all laws – what would society then become?

That’s right; it would make us a theocracy and that is just not America – thank goodness!

Depending on the source, anywhere from 73 to 78 percent of white evangelicals approve of how Donald Trump is doing in office. In contrast, Trump struggles to get out of the 40s in most national job approval polls. So how can fundies essentially think Trump walks on water, while the nation as a whole thinks his administration is FUBAR?









Well, for the last three months, the religious right has convinced most of the 81 percent of white evangelicals who voted for Trump in November that the protests and attacks he’s faced are being driven by witchcraft, demons, and the devil himself. Therefore, the reasoning goes, those who oppose “God’s plan for America” are essentially guilty of sedition. When you consider that a significant segment of the religious right base has been conditioned to believe that voting for a Democrat could endanger their salvation, it’s easy to see how so many of them are still bowing to Trump.

People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch recently discovered that one prominent religious right leader drove the point home last week. He told his followers that under Trump, there’s a lot opening up for Christians in this country–and that evil spirits are hellbent on blocking those openings.

Much of Trump’s early religious right support came from the New Apostolic Reformation, an overtly fascist branch of the religious right that believes it can bring about the Second Coming by taking over the world under the leadership of self-proclaimed apostles and prophets. One of those “apostles” is Dutch Sheets. He’s one of the more popular speakers in NAR circles, and oversees a network of NAR-aligned “prayer alliances” in every state.

Last week, Sheets gave his take on the North Korean threat, and a number of other topics. Watch here.

Sheets told his followers what he says God recently told him–“the spiritual realm of darkness is about to start manifesting.” He believed he was seeing it first-hand, based on a number of factors–including the protests against Trump, as well as the increased belligerence from Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un. To his mind, all of this could be chalked up to “the manifestation of evil spirits.”









To Sheets’ mind, these evil spirits are in a tizzy because the church is moving into “a season of great breakthrough” after years of praying for one. He likened it to how Israel fought against Canaan, recounting how Rahab told the Israelites that her people had been terrified of Israel for 40 years. Ultimately, they needed to fight or else God would give their land to the Israelites. He believes God told him to tell his followers not to be afraid because “his enemies are afraid.”

Sheets went on to urge his followers to pray for the overthrow of Kim’s regime. That’s something most people on both sides of the aisle want to see happen. But once he claimed that the protests against Trump are driven by evil spirits, he might as well have sounded like a Peanuts adult. He has effectively said that the protests aren’t legitimate.

Here’s a news flash, Dutch. People aren’t resisting and persisting because of demons. They’re doing it because a man who lost the popular vote by over three million votes is pushing this country on a double-time march toward the cliff. If you expect us to remain silent for that, there’s a bridge in Brooklyn you might be interested in buying.

As unhinged as this is, it’s even more so when you consider that Sheets believes Christians need to realize that they are “God’s governing force on the earth,” and thus have the power to “legislate from the spiritual realm.” Does this mean that these “evil spirits” are supposedly preventing Christians from taking their rightful place as the governing force in this world? Sure sounds like it–though I wouldn’t want to live in Sheets’ kind of world. After all, he also believes that Christians should focus on taking over the world above all else.

This is off-the-charts extreme, even by religious right standards. However, Sheets has a good deal of influence in “mainstream” conservative circles as well. Just months after Sheets called for Christians to focus on taking over the world, Newt Gingrich named him national co-chairman of his 2012 presidential campaign’s “Faith Leaders Coalition.”

It’s simply mind-boggling that even in the face of Trump’s outrages, the religious right seems to have remained loyal to him. Well, now we have the answer–the movement’s leaders are telling their followers that all the opposition to Trump is being driven by evil spirits. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the only reason Trump’s head is still above water in the polls.

"By reality-based standards, Donald Trump’s presidency is very close to the rocks. According to Nate Silver’s model of approval poll averages, Trump only has an approval rating of 42.4 percent as of Wednesday night. Even at this early stage, this would be code-calling territory for any politician.









But those approval ratings would be even lower than that if not for the large number of white evangelicals who are still bowing before the Orange Calf. Depending on the source, anywhere from 73 to 78 percent of white evangelicals approve of how Trump is doing–which means Trump is holding onto nearly all of the white evangelicals who backed him in November. Well, on Memorial Day Weekend, some of Trump’s most fanatical evangelical supporters are due to descend on the Charlotte area.

Many of Trump’s earliest fundie supporters came from the New Apostolic Reformation, an overtly fascist offshoot of the religious right that believes it can bring about the Second Coming by taking over the world under the leadership of so-called apostles and prophets. Just before Inauguration Day, several of them gathered to announce the formation of “POTUS Shield,” which intends to “storm heaven” and “raise up a shield of prayer and prophetic understanding” for Trump.









Recently, POTUS Shield announced plans for a “convocation” to take place over Memorial Day Weekend at Rick Joyner’s MorningStar Ministries in Fort Mill, South Carolina–based at what was once Jim Bakker’s Heritage USA, about 20 minutes south of Charlotte. Joyner is a member of POTUS Shield’s council, and has been one of Trump’s most rabid fundie supporters. Among other things, he believes that the opposition to Trump is driven by witchcraft and is backed by Satan himself. He would also have you believe that if you stand against Trump, you risk being “smacked” by God. In other words, he’s earned his place on this council.

But there’s a lot more lunacy where that came from. Alveda King, Martin Luther King’s rabidly pro-life niece, is a member of the council. So is Cindy Jacobs, who claimed birds fell dead after the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and believes that Christians should get risk in order to make Jews jealous enough to convert. So is Lance Wallnau, who claims the tables are about to turn on the anti-Trump forces and their media-driven witchcraft. So is Lou Engle, the guy who got little kids to pray for “righteous judges” to overturn abortion in “Jesus Camp” and who leads the homophobic and anti-abortion “TheCall” rallies.

If POTUS Shield’s last convocation, held in March, is any indication, the crazy is going to be very strong in Charlotte over Memorial Day. The March convocation was held at Touch Heaven Ministries in Canfield, Ohio. That church’s pastor, Frank Amedia, is a member of the POTUS Shield council; he once refused to help Haitian earthquake victims if they practiced voodoo. That gathering saw Engle pray for the removal of pro-choice judges–either by way of conversion or death. In case you missed it, watch here.

And Amedia claimed that he knew Trump had been wiretapped. Never mind that the FBI and Republican-controlled committees in both chambers have called BS on it–God told Amedia that Trump’s wires really had been tapped. Watch here.

An indication of the kind of praying that may take place at this gathering comes from another council member, Mina Holmes. Recently, she traveled to Claremont School of Theology and prayed to break “liberal thinking” on that campus and others in Southern California. Watch here.

Yep, the crazy is definitely going to be very strong in my hometown over Memorial Day Weekend.

Texas Republican Randy Weber has given a prayer that turned into a plea for forgiveness from God for the ‘sins’ of this nation. Speaking at the A Man of Prayer event in Washington, Weber began with the Lord’s prayer and then asked for God’s forgiveness for many things including the separation of church and state in schools. He offered an apology to God for having drug-sniffing dogs at school instead of the ten commandments.









Of same sex marriage laws Weber says with emotion:

“Father, we’ve trampled on your holy institution of holy matrimony and tried to rewrite what it is and we’ve called it an alternate lifestyle… father, oh father, please forgive us.”

His tears here are questionable. He then moves on to abortion:

“Lord we have gone to kill the most innocent among us… we are killing our descendants and we’re calling it a choice.”

Weber’s rant about modern America and even goes as far to call the country’s debt a sin.

Randy Weber obviously does not want same sex marriage. He feels it contradicts the bible. That is his belief and his choice.

However, there are gay people in this world, some happen to be Christian and some non-Christian people. These citizens are naturally attracted to the same gender as their own. These people have every right to be an equal part of our society and that includes marriage. It is a matter of equality.









The fact that Weber would cry over the fact that a group in society have been given equal rights is sickening and the opposite of the compassion that Jesus Christ himself was famous for.

Weber is also anti abortion and cries about it. Well imagine the tears of the countless women who face this scenario for a wide range of reasons. This is not a black and white issue. This is about the importance of giving women who have found themselves in a pregnancy that could cause great psychological or physical harm a real choice about what happens to their bodies.

Weber wants the church to be back in schools. How about giving all school children, who are still developing, the ability to think critically, so that when they are fully grown they can make a rational decision about belief. Surely this is preferable to an indoctrinated view from a very young age.

Weber’s attempt to appear emotional about these issues makes his comments even more despicable. His version of his faith is one thing, equality within society is quite another.

Watch Weber make his tearful prayer here:

For the better part of three decades, Benny Hinn has fit every stereotype most of us associate with televangelists. The opulent lifestyle, expensive suits, a near-fanatical following, the lot. Hinn is best known for his healing crusades, at which people topple over with a mere wave of his hand.









Speaking as a charismatic/pentecostal who has watched Hinn’s act for two decades, something about his act has always seemed phony. As it turns out, a number of investigations have raised concerns about whether Hinn is legitimate. Perhaps the most damning came in 2005, when CBC’s “The Fifth Estate” revealed that many people with obvious medical and physical conditions never make it on stage to declare they’ve been healed. The report also revealed that Hinn spends money in a way that one forensic accountant found hard to reconcile with legitimate business objectives. Watch the whole thing here.

Hinn was able to dodge the questions raised about his spending then. He tried–and mostly failed–to answer more questions in a 2009 interview with “Nightline.”

But they may be about to catch up with him. On Wednesday, investigators with the IRS and Postal Inspection Service descended on Hinn’s headquarters in Grapevine, Texas to execute a search warrant. As is their custom, they were mum about the details. The U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas would neither confirm nor deny if Hinn is the target of an investigation.









However, WFAA in Dallas discovered some strong indications Hinn is indeed under the federal microscope. Watch here.

The agents rolled into Hinn’s offices at around 9 a. m. on Wednesday, and were still there by late Wednesday afternoon. White trucks showed up later in the afternoon, and agents were seen carrying boxes out of the trucks and into the building. A federal source was mum about specifics, but did tell WFAA that this was part of a very lengthy investigation. An IRS investigator on site added that the IRS agents were part of the Criminal Investigation Division, which looks into tax evasion and general fraud against the federal government.

In other words–all indications are that Hinn has a lot of reasons to be very afraid. And that list may be growing. According to KXAS-TV in Fort Worth, investigators showed up at Hinn’s offices for a second day on Thursday.

Clearly, the IRS think there’s smoke. But is there a fire? A longtime watchdog of religious fraudsters certainly thinks so. Ole Anthony of the Trinity Foundation–best known as the guy who helped expose Robert Tilton as a fraud–told WFAA that historically, “the IRS has been loath to investigate any religious organization,” even though there is “more fraud in the name of God” than virtually anything else in the world. Translation–if the IRS is even looking into Hinn, in all likelihood there’s a there there."

I write a Christian left blog. The site I write for is a far left, radically liberal site called Liberal America. It focuses especially on issues of the marginalized, poverty, corporate greed, bigotry, discrimination, and hypocrisy. It supports itself with Google ads, which often include ads for dating websites, Viagra, and other non-workplace-appropriate elements. Clicking on a link to one of my blogs often pulls up some pretty disgusting ads, and I am told that I should write for Pathos, or Christianity Today, or some other “more appropriate” site or publication.

But I don’t. And I won’t.









I didn’t do any of this on purpose. A friend who owns the site contacted me and asked me to be the Christian voice on their extremely non-religious site. I had no idea what I was agreeing to, as my first few postings were basically shortened sermons and didn’t get much of a response except for people who read Liberal America commenting that I was an idiot, and that I believed in a sky fairy. Then one day as I sat in front of my computer watching my Christian friends post hateful things about gun control after yet another college shooting, and then more hateful things about the LGBTQ community over legalized gay marriage, I became angry and wrote a blog entry. The internet went crazy with it and within two hours, I was the “Pissed Off Southern Pastor.” I had to shut down my personal Facebook page for a week because people were requesting to friend me, and sending me inbox messages, at a rate of literally one hundred an hour.

In the next few days, I reactivated my Facebook page, did a lot of praying, and discovered a world of “nones and dones” who were desperate for a religious leader to say some of the things I had said. I began to work my way through hundreds of messages and emails from people who had been moved by what I had said. Apparently, there were a lot of people who were pissed off, and they were relieved to have a religious spokesperson who had said publicly what they had been afraid to say themselves.









In the last 18 months since the “Pissed Off” article ran, I have posted ninety-two blogs, and I have been called out on them numerous times by others in the church who believe that I shouldn’t write what I write or where I write it. On the Liberal America page itself, I get called horrible names and made fun of by agnostics and atheists who think I am a joke. But the best part is what no one else sees. I didn’t intend to become an advocate for the LGBTQ community. I was outspoken in the original article about all kinds of radically unloving things, not just discrimination and attacks on the LGBTQ community, but that group of people reached out to me in ways I never expected.

Today, I pray with transgender people in France, lesbian couples in Belgium, and gay men in Texas. I have chatted with lesbian couples as they shopped in Barnes and Noble for the first Bible either of them had held in 20 years. I direct people to the Reconciling Ministries Network, so that they can find a church home where they will be loved and accepted. I message with teenagers trying to find the courage to come out, and with elderly people who regret that they never did. These are people who desired a relationship with the church but felt unwanted and even condemned. Just hearing a pastor get publicly mad about the fact that they were being made to feel that way by much of the Christian world was all they needed to reach out.

Colossians 3:12-15

12 As God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. 13 Bear with one another and, if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive each other; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. 14 Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. 15 And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful.

I am no longer devastated by any backlash which might come from my writing, and when I am told that I should “rethink my relationship with that website,” I explain that Jesus didn’t open the doors of a building and say, “come inside;” he went to where the people were.

Luke 19:10

10 For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.”

People who have been left out or hurt by the church read websites which agree with them about the damage the church can do, so that is where I choose to write. I don’t mind the names I get called on the page itself, because I know the messages I receive in private are what counts.

There are many progressively thinking clergy in rural southern America, but when we were at a conference, and the Reconciling Ministries Network was passing out rainbow buttons which read “Y’all Means All,” several took the buttons, but put them in their pockets for fear of people seeing them and that being an obstacle in their appointments. As I sat that day and pondered it, I took my button out and put it proudly on. Either I am going to live my calling, or it isn’t real. It was four months after that when I wrote the Southern Pastor article which forced me to live into that fully.

When I am in the pulpit, I preach the Gospel. I don’t discuss politics, and if the Gospel upsets your politics, then that is between you and God. I am only trying to preach what Jesus taught. Then several times a week, I try to set aside time to manage the page I created on Facebook, and answer the ever-growing number of messages which I receive as a result. And therein lies the problem.

I only find the time once or twice a week to check in on my page and messages. And I only find time to write something new once or twice a month, sometimes not even that much. People need pastoral care and inspiration; they are facing life’s problems and issues in which they need to know they are not alone. They are searching for support and guidance through sanctifying grace all the time. As an appointed part-time pastor, in seminary full-time, and working a part-time secular job to be able to pay the bills, I simply do not have the time to be in ministry in this obviously, massive, mission field. But there is an answer.

We, as the church, must begin to view and approach ministry in its current context, and stop attempting to fit 21st century ministry needs into 16th century ministry models. We can’t keep wondering why people are not coming to church on Sunday mornings, and yet keep pouring our funds into building more and bigger church buildings for Sunday morning attendance.

In Henri J. M. Nouwen’s book, A Spirituality of Fundraising, he beautifully explains the idea of creating space in which to discuss a real need for financial stewardship and a concise understanding of how money and ministry are really one. Nouwen explains that we must stop equating money with power and thinking that funding something in any way takes away existing power in the church. By withholding financial support from newer and more relevant mission fields and approaches, the church hierarchy isn’t holding power in the already existing church organizations; they are blocking the investment of many others who are unable to find a comfortable place to give in the existing structure. (pp. 29-31) People who have never experienced church, or who have been hurt by a previous church experience, or who simply don’t feel comfortable in the traditional church building setting, can be brought into fellowship with the larger church organization by offering them a place and a method which is more appropriate and comfortable to them. When they connect with the church as a whole, it doesn’t take away from the existing church hierarchy or structure, it simply brings even more gifts, talents, resources, and witness into the church as a whole. (pp. 36-41)

Christians want to reach the unchurched. They want to find the “nones and the dones” and speak to them about Jesus. They obviously want to, or we wouldn’t be able to raise billions of dollars a year to build more church buildings. What we have to do is break away from the idea that the unchurched will come to us if we have a big pretty door to open, and begin to realize that it is our job to go out and find the unchruched, and in many cases, minister to them right where they already are.

It seems the thinking is that subsidizing a coffee shop ministry, or an online ministry, or any other alternate setting, is a threat to the budget which is already stretched, and in some cases, failing. We must let go of this type of thinking. Spreading the gospel however, wherever, and whenever people need to hear it simply must become the focus. And for that to be the focus, we have to let go of the idea that a church only exists as long as a building does. Church is an idea, a belief, a commission, and a covenant, and Jesus never once said it required a building.

We do not look at the theology of sexuality to purposefully start some sort of argument. And I did not write about the LGBTQ community because I wanted to start some sort of revolution in the church. But if we are really trying to be a prophetic voice, it is our job to continually be delving deeper, and reinterpreting in original and relevant ways, or we are just repeating the missions, needs, and ministries of a bunch of German philosophers from centuries ago. While it would certainly be difficult to take attendance and keep records the way we are accustomed to, reaching the people must take precedence over stockpiling numbers and maintaining the status quo.

Sometimes I still get told that I am a divisive element, and the church is concerned about my choice of writing. But any night when I have the time to answer the messages and emails from people I have never physically met, I am convinced that this is a new place of ministry which will become more and more relevant in the near future.

I am not sure of the answers, just that there are questions we should be asking, and it is our job as Christians to ask them. I am not afraid of what we might find by looking at the Bible in new and necessary ways; my faith is stronger than that. And I am not afraid of accepting that bigger and more opulent buildings may not be the future of the church. We cannot think in only old ways and expect to get new results. It is time to rethink and recommit the way the funding of the church is handled. It is absolutely imperative that we do. It is scary, but it is necessary.

I propose that less building projects be approved, and more non-building appointments be created. The money is already there; the question is will we be brave enough to use it in new ways to reach God’s people wherever and however they need to be reached.

Only through committed prayer and trusting cooperation can the church open its eyes to the future. We must fund online, on the street, and in the neighborhood appointments, and stop building structures, which not only are not attracting the “nones and dones” to God, but are a physical and lasting testimony to our lack of commitment to go out and seek those in need where they are in this wounded world.

Ben Carson, the former presidential candidate, is a soft spoken intellectual. He is by all accounts a brilliant surgeon with gentle hands and a serene demeanor.









Even so, sometimes he sounds like a complete idiot. The man who now serves as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a habit of making ignorant statements.









For example, he once said that the Holocaust wouldn’t have been as bad if the Jews had owned guns. He said that slavery was a form of immigration.

Yup.

Secretary Carson is at it again.

This week he told a reporter that to a large extent, poverty is a “state of mind.” He said:

“You take somebody that has the right mindset, you take everything from them and put them on the street and I guarantee in a little while they’ll be right back up there. And you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they’ll work their way right back down to the bottom.”

Sure, Doc! Just tell those hungry kids that if they put their minds to it, food will magically appear on the table. Great advice for single Moms with no chance at education. Just think happy thoughts and you’ll have your own home in a flash.

Why in the world would the Secretary of HUD be saying things like this? After all, that’s the agency that is supposed to be helping poor Americans to find safe and affordable housing. Its purpose is to help protect those who are mired in poverty.

Maybe Dr. Carson is making these ridiculous comments because his boss just sent out a budget proposal that will cut $6 billion dollars from his agency.

Maybe he’s hoping that people can lean how to help themselves with positive thinking, since they won’t be getting any actual government help.

What a joke.

Is healthcare a privilege? Or is healthcare a right? It’s a nuanced debate.

When it comes to that debate, according to Kevin D. Williamson in his article The ‘Right’ to Healthcare:

“There isn’t one.”

That’s certainly a hard pill to swallow, particularly for people with chronic illness, or perhaps more popularly, “preexisting conditions.” It’s a term that needs unpacking, but that’s another article.









Williamson goes on to say there will always be limits on healthcare. He also seems to suggest that the limit to health care is less about cost and more about available resources, personnel, and time. With that stated, he adds that enough money will secure the care that one needs, because, according to Williamson:

“Rich people get better stuff.”

I can agree with that. More money usually means access to more goods, or a higher quality of goods, or both. Where we part ways, however, is the laissez faire manner in which Williamson accepts the healthcare situation, particularly for poor folk in comparison to rich folk, as inevitable, instead of looking at the causes, or coming up with solutions.

The Problem:

Money isn’t the limit Williamson thinks it is. Yes, things cost money. However, the problem is the stark difference of healthcare between the poor and the wealthy. Does healthcare really cost as much as we pay for it?

Healthcare And Services Are Limited By Providers

As I mentioned, Williamson leads his article stating that there will always be a limitation of some kind on health care, and he makes the point that it’s a matter of providers and provisions.









To do this, further in his article, Williamson claims to take money out of the equation. He talks about economics, a demand that outpaces the supply. However, this problem comes back to money too. Supply and demand are both intrinsically tied to money. Shortages, artificial or real, drive up prices.

True, there is a finite amount of resources on the planet. However, we can stretch those resources more than we do, or for more effect. We can use the supply more efficiently to meet the demand while keeping prices stable.

Artificially inflated costs make it difficult for medical facilities to keep up a supply. Most medicines are (relatively) cheap to produce; it’s the R&D that costs. Why is medication so expensive?

It Is All About The Profit Margin

Money that is no longer available to be made due to fair pricing is the opportunity cost of those who would otherwise get rich off of ridiculous markups.

Martin Shkreli , a.k.a. ‘Pharmabro’ is the poster child of this. He’s not the first one. He’s not the only one.

But even assuming a legitimate shortage of supply… In the case of healthcare, shortages of healthcare are localized, and really only exist for those who are impoverished. More resources there would increase the availability of providers, because those people who can afford medical care already get it without the need for community clinics.

That being said….

Inability To Solve One Problem Doesn’t Mean We Should Ignore Other Problems

If Williamson is really concerned about the lack of availability, why not see this as an opportunity to offer a solution? While acknowledging the problem, he instead chooses to misrepresent those concerned about the cost of healthcare.

“There is no substitute for abundance. And the great enemy of abundance is the bias against profit. There is something deeply rooted in us that instinctively thinks we are being abused if someone else makes a profit on a deal.”

The problem is not a matter of people hating others who profit. In reality, it’s a discontent with people who profit literally at the expense of others’ lives. Essentially, people who are abusing others AND making a profit for doing so. Low quality, high cost healthcare certainly is no substitute for abundance.

Either way, Williamson offers no solution to the actual problem, nor the facsimile he presents.

We can fix healthcare. In the process, we can solve the problem of jobs and the economy. The problems are linked.

Lower the costs of healthcare goods and services. Lower the cost of healthcare personnel training. Increase the quality of both through research and development.

In the short term, this means a financial hit. That’s why it hasn’t been done. In other words, there is something “deeply rooted” in us that instinctively thinks we are being abused when we can’t make money off of other people.

In the long term, it means more people with healthcare jobs. It means more people get the treatment they need. It means more people, now that they can afford healthcare, can go back to work and help stimulate the economy, instead of getting sicker and sicker, costing us more money.

Cost Vs. Benefit

To make one final point about cost: at the end of his article, Williamson uses the price of the Ferrari as an indication of his doctor’s skill and worth.

“My doctor had a picture on his wall in which he was posing with a Ferrari — one of his Ferraris. I was driving a Saturn VUE at the time. This seemed wrong in some way. ‘I think I am paying you too much,’ I said. He took a pensive moment, and responded: ‘Do you really want a doctor who can’t afford a Ferrari?'”

However, money doesn’t necessarily indicate quality or competence. This is evident given that the U.S. spends so much on healthcare, and yet still holds a mediocre ranking in healthcare quality.

A system that works great for a select few and poorly for the masses isn’t ideal for a democracy.

I don’t care if my doctor can afford a Ferrari.

I just care that I can get quality medical care when I need it.

And doctors and Ferraris have nothing to do with each other in that regard.

If there’s one thing Republicans excel at (other than lying and making excuses for their criminal behavior), it’s finding new ways to screw the poorest and most vulnerable among us. If you’re poor, have a disability, or cannot afford decent healthcare, it must be your fault, and you shouldn’t expect any help from the government.









House budget writers are busily working on deep new cuts to the American social safety net, including programs such as food stamps, welfare, income assistance for the disabled, and even veterans benefits.

Worse, the budget hawks in the GOP are also looking for ways to cut as much as $400 billion in social spending through a process which would allow them to subvert Democratic filibusters in the Senate.

Additionally, those crafting the 2018 budget are also under instructions from House Speaker Paul Ryan to help him realize his long-held dream of privatizing Medicare, which could wind up leaving millions of American seniors holding the bag for increased premiums, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses.









Congressman Tom Cole (R-OK) told Politico:

“The Budget Committee is trying to force the entire conference and committees of jurisdiction to focus on ways to bring down this deficit.”

If grandma has to cut back on how often she eats or what medications she can afford to take, that’s just too damn bad, the Republicans seem to be saying.

An agreement which kept the government running until September reportedly angered the White House, as Trump had to take heat from the right flank of his party which suggested he had given Democrats everything they wanted while managing to not get a dime for his promised border wall. That frustration, Virginia GOP Congressman Dave Brat says, will be reflected in the 2018 budget:

“The critique last time was that we didn’t embed enough Trump agenda items into our budget. [Trump] made it clear it will be embedded in this budget. … And so people will see a process much more aligned with President Trump’s agenda in this forthcoming budget.”

Translation: More money for the Defense Department, more for a wall, and less for everything else, even if that means cutting out programs which benefit those who have served this country in combat.

Of course, all of this supposes that Trump will still be able to sign a budget if one is passed. Instead, he may be involved in the fight of his life as more revelations come out about his connections to Russia and the rigging of the 2016 election.

The House Republicans may have passed their healthcare bill last Thursday, but GOP Senators are saying they want to write their own bill. Most likely, they won’t even vote on the current Trumpcare plan.









Surprisingly, one Republican senator even wants to create a bill that has the approval of late-night show host, Jimmy Kimmel. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La) said:

“As you present that, I ask does it pass the Jimmy Kimmel test?”

“Would the child born with a congenital heart disease be able to get everything he or she would need in that first year of life? I want it to pass the Jimmy Kimmel test.”

Senator @BillCassidy ""the senate will write its own bill,"" says he will push to ""expand risk pools"" https://t.co/m7jsBHKj4V — CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) May 5, 2017

Cassidy has been working on a bill that would provide all those services to the child even if the costs went over a certain amount. However, it may not be all sunshine and roses. The GOP Senate plan is still a step back from The Affordable Care Act.

Under Senator Cassidy’s plan, states could choose to stay with the Affordable Care Act or they could receive a similar amount in federal money. That money would be used for consumers to pay for medical care and health insurance. He said:

“We are moving the locus of repeal to state government. States should have the right to choose.”

The proposal created by both Senator Cassidy, a physician, and Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), is called The Patient Freedom Act. The bill does maintain dependent coverage until age 26, prohibits preexisting condition exclusions, and does not impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits.









The bill has also been met with a lot of criticism from Democrats. After all, it is still a typical Republican bill. Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said this:

“Millions of Americans would be kicked off their plans, out-of-pocket costs and deductibles for consumers would skyrocket, and protections for people with preexisting conditions, such as cancer, would be gutted.”

A joint statement by six groups including the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American College of Physicians was released which says:

“We urge the Senate to promptly put aside the AHCA, and instead work with our organizations to achieve real bipartisan solutions to improve affordability, access, and coverage for all.”

Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, said the bill:

“falls way short of providing the protections and coverage people have under the Affordable Care Act.”

Right now, Senate Republicans lack the 60 votes needed to block a filibuster by Democrats.

Keith Olberman does not mince words and gave a stern message about the GOP’s treatment of Americans and their celebration over the recent healthcare vote in the House of Representatives. The cruel part is that there are many people with conditions, which could be well-managed with proper medical treatment and medication. However, under the bill The House passed last Thursday, people with conditions like diabetes could potentially die.









House Republicans, many of whom did not even read the bill, voted to repeal Obamacare in favor of the American Healthcare Act. The bill would essentially strip many Americans of their affordable coverage and ultimately healthcare period.

One of the most damaging things it does is wipe away the requirement for insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions. Preexisting conditions include almost everything imaginable such as diabetes, cancer, genetic conditions, pregnancy, newborn care coverage, rape, and domestic violence to name only a few.









Basically, insurance does not have to cover ANYTHING!

Olberman draws parallels between George F. Baer of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad in 1903, and current Republican politicians. In front of a commission of 558 people, Baer attempted to justify horrible, slave-like working conditions in the coal mines. Many children worked long hours and were practically unpaid, and there were virtually no safety standards. This resulted in many grotesque injuries and deaths.

He defended the rich men who profited from it saying “These men don’t suffer. Hell! Half of them don’t even speak English!” It was said of him:

“His colleagues have been willing to paralyze the nation to affect not just at least 10% of the economy, but to at best inconvenience and to at worst literally threaten the lives of virtually all of its citizens.”

“They had a mandate to protect what their side believed, and their side had all the money.”

The stark similarities are frightening. Are they going to stand up and justify poor people dying because of the greed of the rich – and not just poor people but the average middle class person who will also drown to afford premiums and pay medical costs under such a selfish plan – “because Hell! Half of them don’t even vote Republican!”?

It’s really upsetting when you think about many of the people who are impacted by such a plan – cancer patients, newborn babies, special needs children, transplant patients, and pretty much all women. Olberman is right when he says:

“Man’s inhumanity to man lives on in Donald Trump and Paul Ryan and in every other so-called human being who fought to repeal the Affordable Care Act.”

President Donald Trump just appointed Teresa Manning, an anti-abortion activist, to oversee the nation’s only federal family planning program for low-income people. What is worse is this woman spreads false information about birth control stating things like emergency contraception destroys “a human life already conceived.” She also falsely claims that abortions cause breast cancer.









Manning said this about birth control:



“Of course, contraception doesn’t work. Its efficacy is very low especially when you consider over years, which you know a lot of contraception health advocates want, to start women in their adolescent years when they’re extremely fertile, incidentally. And continue for 10, 20, 30 years, over that span of time the prospect that contraception would always prevent the conception of a child is preposterous.”

Manning’s ultra-conservative background includes being a lobbyist with the National Right to Life Committee and a legislative analyst for the Family Research Council. The Title X program that she will lead serves about 4 million Americans per year.

Senator Patty Murray (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, stated:

“Trump is stacking his administration with one extreme, anti-abortion activist after another and ignoring the millions of men and women who don’t want to see women’s health and rights go backward.”

“Ms. Manning has repeatedly spread false information about women’s health and advocated for policies that would undermine women’s access to birth control and other essential health care. She is a completely inappropriate choice for this role.”

This move is part of a series of actions by Trump to undermine women and their healthcare. On Thursday, April 13, he signed a bill that would allow states to withhold federal family planning dollars from clinics that provide abortion services.









Contrary to what some people may think, the United States is currently at an all-time low for teen pregnancies, and a 30-year low for unintended pregnancies.

According to the Guttmacher Institute,

“Title X–supported services have greatly benefited women, families and society. In 2014, the contraceptive care delivered by Title X–funded providers helped women avoid 904,000 unintended pregnancies, which would have resulted in 439,000 unplanned births and 326,000 abortions.2 Without the contraceptive care provided by these health centers, the U.S. rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion would have been 33% higher, and the teen pregnancy rate would have been 30% higher.”

The Trump Administration is basically assaulting women and their families. As cited in the statistics above, when you provide contraception, you decrease abortion rates dramatically. It is amazing how much our government can just deny what is common sense.

Then again, we have to remember they deny science!

Perhaps, conservatives don’t actually care about preventing abortions as much as they want women to be second class citizens who obey their husbands, stay fertile, and produce a lot of children. Do we really want to go back to a time when women were treated as commodities?

It is morally reprehensible that we have government officials who call themselves pro-life, but pass healthcare bills that make pregnancy, rape, and domestic violence all preexisting conditions – And now can’t be trusted to help low-income women make good choices supported by science.

It is certainly not pro-the-life of a woman. It sends the message that being a woman is shameful, and that women cannot be trusted to make important choices about having children or their lives in general.

We haven’t heard much from Ben Carson since he became Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and that’s probably a good thing considering the fact that Dr. Carson has a habit of spouting off WTF?! statements at the drop of a hat.









Carson is back, and he’s been touring housing facilities across the state of Ohio. The New York Times tagged along and reports that Carson was delighted to see that at one homeless shelter television was not provided to the residents. Carson said that fits in with his view of being compassionate because it’s a bad idea to provide:

“A comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say: ‘I’ll just stay here. They will take care of me.'”

Yeah, because those who are homeless dream of being homeless for the rest of their lives, don’t they, Ben?

At an apartment complex for veterans, Carson was reportedly upset that the facility was so fancy that all it lacked, according to him, were “pool tables.”









If Carson’s boss and the GOP Congress have their way, lots of those veterans will probably be looking for a place to live. The Trump administration’s budget calls for cutting the HUD budget by some $6 billion. Trump is also seeking to eliminate a program that helps poor people heat their homes in the winter, for a savings of $3.3 billion, which is 0.2 percent of discretionary spending. Apparently that money is needed to finance tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, who rarely have any trouble heating or cooling their mansions.

Carson said he didn’t think the HUD budget would be completely eliminated, commenting:

“I know they have been called out for elimination. My impression is that what [President Trump] is really saying is that there are problems with those programs. And I think it may have been someone on his staff who kind of said, ‘Well, maybe we just need to get rid of the whole program.’ No, we don’t need to get rid of the whole program because there are some extremely good things there.”

How about we make Trump and his filthy rich cabinet members pay for the homeless in this country? That sounds a lot fairer than kicking people out into the street so the Trump family can get a YUGE tax cut.

"Some countries in Europe and a few states here in the U.S. have experimented with universal basic incomes for its citizens. However, could this work across the entire country here?









What Is Universal Basic Income?

First off, a universal basic income is similar to Social Security in that everyone gets a fixed amount of money on a regular basis. It can be provided by the government or some other public organization. It is provided unconditionally, whether a person works or not. For people who work, it is given on top of what they already make.

The goal is to let everyone have a chance to attain an adequate quality of life.

Has This Been Tried Anywhere?

There have been multiple experiments at basic incomes. In 2009, London did a small experiment of giving homeless people money. They thought that doing so would save them the police expenses, court costs, and other hassles of dealing with the homeless people. After a year-and-a-half, seven of the thirteen people had rooves over their heads!

It was tried here in the United States in a few places in the 1970s.

As Canadian professor Evelyn Forget put it:

“The political right is afraid people will stop working and the left doesn’t trust them to make their own choices.”

Then-President Richard Nixon supported it, but the universal basic income didn’t survive the bureaucratic process. In the experiments, Forget found that young people put off getting married when given a basic income. Also, hospitalizations dropped eight percent. Wouldn’t it be amazing if people who needed it could get assistance without the reams of paperwork and years of bureaucracy?









Finland is trying a similar program with a group of unemployed people. The hope is that it will cut the unemployment rate and reduce poverty. The income is paid even if they find work. Working and self-employment are also encouraged. However, that safety net is wonderful for someone who is unemployed.

Other Benefits

In addition to the obvious benefits of cutting poverty and unemployment, there are other benefits to a universal basic income as well. It could lead to a more efficient use of natural resources. The citizens will know what resources their country has. Also, this gives citizens an incentive to look at how their taxes are being spent. This can be seen in the oil-rich countries of Africa.

Additionally, this raises the quality of life for the poorer people of the country. The person will also be more empowered being given the money and being able to choose how they spend it.

A universal basic income may also come in handy in the future when many jobs may be eliminated due to advances in technology.

Here is a Ted Talk on the subject:

When you think of someone living in poverty what comes to mind? The word “lazy” maybe? Perhaps “lack of morals” is a phrase you think of? Even the term “irresponsible” may come into play? This is the stereotype faced by a massive part of the United States’ population that lives at or below the “poverty line.” This state, also known as the federal poverty level is a level of income based on the state of residence and the weighted average of cost of living. Determining at what point income dips below the state’s cost of living is the criteria used to determine eligibility for helpful programs.









What if the issue of systemic poverty stems from those who profit off of these individual’s struggles rather than inadequacies on the part of the poor?

For example, Tobin Charney (a landlord in Milwaukee, Wisconsin) makes almost half a million dollars a year from his trailer park rentals. He owns and rents out 131 different trailers, all ill-maintained, and profits to the tune of $400,000 a year — all on the backs of poverty-stricken tenants that can barely afford the rent.

The standard scale used by economists is that rent should be no more than 25-30 percent of total income. For those that live below the poverty line, that chunk of cash can be as much as 60-70 percent of their income.

A story about a man named Lamar living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin diagrams this perfectly. Lamar recalls his tale: When he pays his landlord $550 out of his welfare check, he only has enough left for $2.19 a day.

Lamar is the father of two that lost his legs to frostbite when he passed out in a drug den.

When that is mentioned, does your opinion of him change? Do you still see the struggling father, or has that picture been replaced by that of the former drug addict?

What race is he to you now?

While you sort out your own personal biases, Lamar’s story continues: When the welfare agency realized there was an error on his check, he was made to pay back the difference. He began selling his food stamps back for half of their face value and volunteered to paint an upstairs apartment to cover what he was not able to pay in rent that month.

But, because Lamar is living in debt to his landlord for a mistake the welfare office made, his landlord can now evict him at a moment’s notice — because that is how the laws are written. And it has been known to happen the second a tenant begins asking for repairs to their trailers and apartments, or at that point when they are deemed to be more of a problem than a meal ticket.

If a better tenant comes along asking for a room, these “nuisance tenants” can then be evicted for the lack of rent payment, even though the landlord has waited three or four months after the incident and the rent has since been brought up to a current status.

There are no laws in place to discourage something like this from happening.

Not just that, but even a steadily-paying tenant can lose their home if the police are called for any reason. It is called the nuisance abatement law (or property nuisance ordinances) and it has been skewed to include even the basic calling of law enforcement to a home.

Even if someone is beating on someone else.

But, the cycle is even worse for women, because they are still fighting wage issues within the workplace and often have the added burden of being a single mother. Finding a landlord to rent a place to a family with a working single mom is scarce.

Surprisingly, a huge deterrent to renting to families, and especially single mothers, is the chance of more property damage caused by children.

Between facing issues with landlords who make hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit every year and because of the ever-present possibility of eviction, people living in poverty are likely to remain there. Any meager savings they manage gets put into other areas of necessity. Battered women stay silent about their pain and struggles and keep their children in those situations because they fear eviction.

To them, a battered home is better than no home.

To them, no savings is better than no home.

Are they “lazy,” or are they preyed upon?

With a land so rich in money, energy, and resources, why is there so much pain and poverty?









Maybe if we began regarding them as “victims” instead of “perpetrators of a particular lifestyle,” maybe the problem could be solved. It is time to change the conversation.

Watch below to see Matthew Desmond talk about this exact issue.

Last week, we witnessed another example of President Donald Trump effacing his predecessor’s legacy under the guise of eliminating “job-killing regulations.”









In what Trump hailed as a “new energy revolution that celebrates American production on American soil,” the United States unraveled former President Barack Obama’s 2015 Clean Power Plan which was designed to reduce carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants thirty-two percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

Those plants produce almost 40 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.

The long-term implications of climate change are mind boggling: rising sea levels due to melting polar ice caps; an increase in unpredictable and extreme weather; new or resurfacing extant diseases; food shortages that could lead to skyrocketing costs; mass migrations that could lead to military conflicts; obscene amounts of money required to construct and/or update levies and dams; an explosion in invasive plant and animal species.

On it goes.

This is not a problem “down the road.” Recently, medical organizations representing over half of American physicians launched a campaign to alert policymakers and the public to climate change’s dangers to public health.

The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health includes the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Geriatrics Society, and other professional medical groups. Dr. Mona Sarfaty, director of the Consortium, said:

“Physicians are on the front lines and see the impacts in exam rooms. What’s worse is that the harms are felt most by children, the elderly, Americans with low-income or chronic illnesses, and people in communities of color.”

The Consortium on Climate and Health’s new report delineates ways climate is already adversely affecting health, including contributing to asthma and other respiratory diseases.

The Zika virus and Lyme disease are significant health risks; however, the report states these ailments are more often found in the tropics. Their presence in more northerly climates results from an increased spread of insect-borne diseases, symptomatic of climate change.

Doctor Aparna Bole, a pediatrician at University Hospital of Cleveland, Ohio, says:

“There is great consensus in scientific, public health and medical literature that acting on climate change is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, public health opportunities of our time. As a pediatrician, I am interested in safeguarding the health of all children. In order to that, safeguarding a healthy environment is critical.”

Bole states that because children’s respiratory rates are faster than adult’s, children are more susceptible to air quality issues. She says:

“The WHO (World Health Organization) estimates that 80 percent of the health burdens of climate change will fall on children under [age] five,” Dr. Bole says.

Asthma is the most prevalent respiratory problem children face, particularly children of color and those hailing from low-income environments. In Cleveland, one in every five African American child suffers from asthma.

Doctor Bole said:

“Children living in poverty are disproportionately impacted by environmental health hazards, and climate change is no different.”

Molly Rauch is policy director for Moms Clean Air Force, an organization advocating for combating climate change and air pollution. She said:

“Asthma is an epidemic in this country. If air pollution makes asthma worse, [parents] want to know about it. And if climate change makes air pollution worse, we actually really need to know about it in order to take care of our children.”

Physicians can use the trust patients put in them to educate about climate change’s imminent health impacts. A 2014 Yale national survey found most Americans trust their primary care physicians more than the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization.

The Consortium plans on delivering its report to Congress, the Trump administration, and CEOs of Fortune 500 Companies to push for transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy.









Dr. Samantha Ahdoot, a pediatrician in Alexandria, Va., and Consortium member, said:

“We have a moral obligation to act on their [patients’] behalf. Given our current understanding today, failure to take prompt substantive action to reduce emissions would be an unprecedented injustice to every current and future child.”

There has never been a worse time to ignore the exigencies of climate change. President Trump and his cabinet may not find it convenient to acknowledge, but we still can pressure our lawmakers and down-ballot candidates in upcoming elections to put climate change mitigation paramount on their agenda.

It is no longer about hotter summers, colder winters, or more beach-front property. It’s about our health and the health of our children.

For some time, the religious right has been among the loudest voices warning us against claiming that Russia hacked the election for Donald Trump. Their explanation? The Kremlin didn’t hack the election–God did. To hear them talk, God was so determined to end abortion and marriage equality that he cast the only vote that really mattered, thus ensuring the Donald’s victory in what can only be described as a miracle. After all, Trump’s platform is supposedly the same as that of the Almighty.









For that reason, the nation’s so-called moral guardians have warned us that opposition to Trump is fueled by witchcraft and demons, and we oppose God’s plan for this country if we persist in opposing the Donald. For good measure, we risk cursing our families if we oppose Trump, since he is God’s chosen one. Well, a leading fundie evangelist recently took this line to its logical conclusion. He claimed that God hacked the election to punish Barack Obama.

Last weekend, the Family Research Council held its annual “Watchmen on the Wall” pastors’ conference in Washington. One of the keynote speakers was Jonathan Cahn, a messianic Jewish rabbi from Wayne, New Jersey–that is, a rabbi who believes Jesus is the Jewish Messiah. Cahn has been one of the darlings of the religious right for some time. Back in 2012, he published “The Harbinger,” a book in which he argued the September 11 attacks were a divine warning to this country for tolerating “immorality,” teaching acceptance of homosexuality, legalizing abortion, and Obama’s supposed sins.

Cahn He first came to national attention in 2014, when he told Pat Robertson that unless things changed, this country has 20 years left at most. Watch here.

In other words, this guy has solid wingnut street cred. He didn’t disappoint when he spoke on the first day of the Watchmen on the Wall conference. People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch got a clip.

Cahn repeated what has become a standard religious right shibboleth about Trump’s upset victory–it was “a sign of God’s hand,” brought about in part by thousands of people going into prayer on election night. If you’ll remember, a lot of fundies believe that the returns began shifting in Trump’s favor right around the time the audience at a Kenneth Copeland-sponsored webcast started praying.









But Cahn asked his audience to consider the possibility that Trump’s upset victory was rooted in “a 4,000-year-old mystery”–the Abrahamic covenant. He was referring to Genesis 12:1-3, in which God promised to not only make Abraham’s descendants a great nation, but to bless those who bless his descendants and curse those who curse them. Cahn paraphrased it as “whatever you do to Israel shall be done to you.”

He then claimed that in 2015, “article after article” came out to claim that the Obama administration was backing a group dedicated to unseating Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. To hear Cahn tell it, God didn’t forget that insult.

“But the Abrahamic covenant says, ‘whatever you do to Israel will be done to you.’ So if you intervene in the election of Israel, well, then God will intervene in your election. If you seek to end the legacy of the leader of Israel, then God will end your legacy. The Obama administration claimed that the Russians intervened. Weell, maybe they did, but the intervention was much higher than the Russians.”

Okay, Rabbi Jonathan. I’ll play. Do you seriously expect us to believe that God inspires people to engage in blatantly criminal behavior? In case you don’t recall, there is nearly irrefutable evidence that a cabal of rogue FBI agents engaged in a campaign of unethical and criminal behavior in the run-up to FBI Director James Comey releasing his now-infamous letter.

The nation’s two most prominent election forecasters both agree that letter was what cost Hillary the election. Nate Silver concluded that letter caused enough late-deciding voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to break for Trump to throw those states–and the election–to him. Likewise, Sam Wang believes Trump kept just enough of his post-letter bounce to win the Electoral College.

So tell me, Rabbi Jonathan. Are you saying that God inspired those agents to violate the Fourth Amendment, the law, and basic standards of decency? That’s what you’d have to believe in order to believe God hacked the election for Trump. I know God’s ways aren’t our ways, but if you seriously think God inspires FBI agents to act in this way, there’s a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you.

But even without that to consider, Cahn’s argument is based on a conspiracy theory. It’s based on the work that 270 Strategies, a consulting firm headed by Obama 2012 national field director Jeremy Bird, did for an NGO opposing Netanyahu’s Likud party in the 2015 Israeli election. That group, OneVoice, received over $300,000 in State Department grants in 2014 for its work in the Israel-Palestine peace process.

That money, combined with the fact that a former Obama campaign operative was involved, caused wingnut heads to explode. Matt Barber and Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel even went as far as to scream for impeachment. Listen here.

This would be roughly like calling for George W. Bush to be impeached over something one of his former cabinet members did after leaving office.

A Senate investigation ultimately found that OneVoice did nothing improper. But if Cain’s spiel is any indication, this shibboleth is still floating around the fundie world. Remember, folks, these are people who mostly rely on the likes of “The 700 Club” and American Family Radio for news.

The only thing that’s a real surprise is that it took this long for a prominent right-winger openly declared that God hacked the election to spite the Kenyan Socialist Mooslamb. But if Cahn thinks for one minute that he can get away with spewing this garbage, he’s got another think coming. Let Cahn have it on Facebook and on Twitter.

Last weekend, the Family Research Council held its annual “Watchmen on the Wall” pastors’ conference in Washington. One of the keynote speakers was Jonathan Cahn, a messianic Jewish rabbi from Wayne, New Jersey–that is, a rabbi who believes Jesus is the Jewish Messiah. Cahn has been one of the darlings of the religious right for some time. Back in 2012, he published “The Harbinger,” a book in which he argued the September 11 attacks were a divine warning to this country for tolerating “immorality,” teaching acceptance of homosexuality, legalizing abortion, and Obama’s supposed sins.

Cahn He first came to national attention in 2014, when he told Pat Robertson that unless things changed, this country has 20 years left at most. Watch here.

In other words, this guy has solid wingnut street cred. He didn’t disappoint when he spoke on the first day of the Watchmen on the Wall conference. People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch got a clip.

Cahn repeated what has become a standard religious right shibboleth about Trump’s upset victory–it was “a sign of God’s hand,” brought about in part by thousands of people going into prayer on election night. If you’ll remember, a lot of fundies believe that the returns began shifting in Trump’s favor right around the time the audience at a Kenneth Copeland-sponsored webcast started praying.









But Cahn asked his audience to consider the possibility that Trump’s upset victory was rooted in “a 4,000-year-old mystery”–the Abrahamic covenant. He was referring to Genesis 12:1-3, in which God promised to not only make Abraham’s descendants a great nation, but to bless those who bless his descendants and curse those who curse them. Cahn paraphrased it as “whatever you do to Israel shall be done to you.”

He then claimed that in 2015, “article after article” came out to claim that the Obama administration was backing a group dedicated to unseating Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. To hear Cahn tell it, God didn’t forget that insult.

“But the Abrahamic covenant says, ‘whatever you do to Israel will be done to you.’ So if you intervene in the election of Israel, well, then God will intervene in your election. If you seek to end the legacy of the leader of Israel, then God will end your legacy. The Obama administration claimed that the Russians intervened. Weell, maybe they did, but the intervention was much higher than the Russians.”

Okay, Rabbi Jonathan. I’ll play. Do you seriously expect us to believe that God inspires people to engage in blatantly criminal behavior? In case you don’t recall, there is nearly irrefutable evidence that a cabal of rogue FBI agents engaged in a campaign of unethical and criminal behavior in the run-up to FBI Director James Comey releasing his now-infamous letter.

The nation’s two most prominent election forecasters both agree that letter was what cost Hillary the election. Nate Silver concluded that letter caused enough late-deciding voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to break for Trump to throw those states–and the election–to him. Likewise, Sam Wang believes Trump kept just enough of his post-letter bounce to win the Electoral College.

So tell me, Rabbi Jonathan. Are you saying that God inspired those agents to violate the Fourth Amendment, the law, and basic standards of decency? That’s what you’d have to believe in order to believe God hacked the election for Trump. I know God’s ways aren’t our ways, but if you seriously think God inspires FBI agents to act in this way, there’s a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you.

But even without that to consider, Cahn’s argument is based on a conspiracy theory. It’s based on the work that 270 Strategies, a consulting firm headed by Obama 2012 national field director Jeremy Bird, did for an NGO opposing Netanyahu’s Likud party in the 2015 Israeli election. That group, OneVoice, received over $300,000 in State Department grants in 2014 for its work in the Israel-Palestine peace process.

That money, combined with the fact that a former Obama campaign operative was involved, caused wingnut heads to explode. Matt Barber and Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel even went as far as to scream for impeachment. Listen here.

This would be roughly like calling for George W. Bush to be impeached over something one of his former cabinet members did after leaving office.

A Senate investigation ultimately found that OneVoice did nothing improper. But if Cain’s spiel is any indication, this shibboleth is still floating around the fundie world. Remember, folks, these are people who mostly rely on the likes of “The 700 Club” and American Family Radio for news.

The only thing that’s a real surprise is that it took this long for a prominent right-winger openly declared that God hacked the election to spite the Kenyan Socialist Mooslamb. But if Cahn thinks for one minute that he can get away with spewing this garbage, he’s got another think coming. Let Cahn have it on Facebook and on Twitter.

Like most left-leaning evangelical Christians, I believe that Christians in public office should be setting the standard, not trying to do an end run around it. Sadly, a state representative in Minnesota is the latest to think that her faith gives her license to avoid being accountable for her votes.









Abigail Whelan represents District 35A in the Minnesota House of Representatives, comprising much of southwestern Anoka County in the northern portion of the Twin Cities. She’s in her second term in the House, but has already made a name for herself as a no-questions-asked social conservative. She was the co-author of Minnesota’s attempt at a bathroom bill, and claimed that the fight against “gender fluidity” was “spiritual” in nature. That bill failed.

She also authored bill that would have yanked state money from the University of Minnesota unless it ended its fetal tissue research program. It also failed, but the fact it even came up for debate led the U of M’s top choice to lead its research into the causes of addiction to decline the position, citing the “many risks inherent in moving our family.”

But those moments pale in comparison to something that happened in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, when the state house considered an important tax bill. During debate on a Democratic-supported amendment that would have closed loopholes for offshore tax havens, Paul Thissen, a Democrat from Minneapolis, tried to get Whelan to clarify why she opposed the bill. Watch the ensuing exchange here.

Thissen wondered if Whelan had any problem with raising taxes on her constituents to protect “people who are hiding money in Liberia.” Whelan did a Mexican hat dance around the question, instead choosing to reflect on “the games that we play here.”









After taking the time to forgive Thissen and the other members of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL, as the Democrats are known in Minnesota) caucus, Whelan decided to share her “eternal perspective” on her two terms in the legislature.

“At the end of the day, when we try to reach an agreement with divided government, we win some, we lose some. Nobody is really happy. But you know what? Happiness and circumstances–not what it’s about. There is actual joy to be found in Jesus Christ. Jesus loves you all. If you would like to get to know him, (if) you’re listening at home, here in this room, please email, call me, would love to talk to you about Jesus, he is the hope of this state and this country.”

Wow. So instead of answering the question, Whelan saw fit to preach on the state house floor. She may have thought she was being a witness for Jesus. But she couldn’t have made herself or her faith look worse. You would think that a born-again Christian legislator would want more than anything to think about the issues and be willing to give coherent arguments about their votes, not look for opportunities to preach at people at every turn.

Listening to this, I couldn’t help but wonder if this was how Minnesota’s most famous Christianist elected official, Michele Bachmann, sounded during her days in the state senate. Ironically, Whelan’s state house district is located almost entirely within the borders of Bachmann’s old congressional district.

After the state house DFLers posted this video on YouTube, Whelan was deservedly slammed up and down on Twitter.

@AbigailWhelan Umm….separation of Church and State exists. Keep it out of your Gov. job. You know, working for all, not just Christians? — Q Henderson (@Heartart10) May 25, 2017

Note to @AbigailWhelan: your job is policy, not being a two bit Protestant missionary. Our Savior doesn't need help from you. — That Bug Girl (@triagegirl) May 25, 2017

@AbigailWhelan How dare you invoke the name of Jesus Christ to get out of answering questions! I suggest you read Sermon on the Mount. — globalnurse (@globalnurse) May 26, 2017

You ""forgive"" Democrats for basically wanting to help the poor? @AbigailWhelan Wow. Perhaps you should rethink your version of Christianity — JerzyPetty (@jerzygirl45) May 25, 2017

.@AbigailWhelan just a gentle reminder that it's completely inappropriate for you, an elected official, to proselytize on the house floor. — Lucipurr (@apocalypsemeeow) May 25, 2017

@AbigailWhelan If your response to legislative Qs is ""lets talk about Jesus"" you're clearly unfit for your position/are doing a disservice to constituents. — Lucipurr (@apocalypsemeeow) May 25, 2017

Ultimately, Whelan let her vote do the talking. She joined the other Republicans in the chamber in killing the amendment.

In just a little over a minute, Whelan became the embodiment of every stereotype out there about born-agains who are either in elected office or have an interest in politics. As one person who wants to bust that stereotype, this video has me shaking my head. Surely the people of her district deserve better. And there’s an outside chance that they may have a chance to get better. Although this district has a distinct Republican lean, it only gave Donald Trump 53 percent of the vote–meaning that it is very winnable on paper.

If you need a reason to get out and vote next year, here’s another one. When Republicans control legislatures, people like Abigail Whelan are empowered.

The whole thing is turning into something of a Shakespearean tragedy.

Back in April, when Newsweek asked me what I thought would happen if President Donald Trump really had colluded with Russia I saw no real need to mince words.

If evidence that Trump was working with the Russians to rig the election comes out, I wrote:

“Then I’m sorry Trump supporters, he’s in trouble. All Democrats and more than enough Republicans will come together in an orgy of national indignation and remove him so quickly that he’ll be led out of the White House in his slippers crying: “FAKE SHOES!”

The stress was of course on the word ‘if.’









Trump enjoys the same presumption of innocence that anyone else does. His position differs mostly in that the president cannot simply be hauled in front of a court to face criminal charges. He can only be impeached and impeachment is a process that cannot be divorced from the political realities of the day (nor indeed from accusations of — and actual– partisan meddling.)

At least the process itself is relatively simple.

Measures For Displeasure

There are, roughly speaking, seven stages to an impeachment. Four take place in the House of Representatives and three occur in the Senate.

The House Judiciary Committee looks at the charges brought before them. They may hold hearings. The committee votes on whether to begin a formal impeachment inquiry. If during the course of the inquiry sufficient evidence of wrongdoing is uncovered, articles of impeachment are drafted. The House of Representatives votes on each article with a simple majority needed to take the whole thing to the next level.

The process now moves to the Senate where:

A trial is held, presided over by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court with the Senators themselves acting as the jury. Members of the House act as the prosecution. A vote is taken with a two-thirds majority required to convict. If convicted, the impeached official is removed from office and punished.

Much Ado About Something

Are any of these steps likely?

The answer is yes. Impeachment in some part is now a virtual certainty. Whether or not it leads a conviction is much more difficult to establish.

That Russia interfered in the U.S. election is now certain. What is less opaque is whether Trump and/or members of his team actively participated in their attempt to subvert American sovereignty.

The principal defense being offered is that since there is little or no substance to the allegations, there’s really no need to conduct an investigation in the first place. Such an argument is of course untenable. It is the very existence of unanswered questions that is driving the desire to dig deeper. The picture is neither whole nor in focus and with each new revelation, each new piece of evidence, another piece of the puzzle slots into place.

Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret.) was forced to resign and then cower behind the 5th amendment. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself from the investigation after lying under oath about his own contacts with the Russians. Special Advisor and walking charisma panacea Jared Kushner met with Russian officials during the course of the campaign. Two other senior aides, J.D. Gordon and Carter Page danced the same hopak.

And then there was Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager who, according to the New York Times, was in active contact with Russian officials in the year before the presidential election.

That’s a lot of dirt to dig through. And as is often the case with multiple investigations, there’s always the possibility that somebody will hit pay dirt.

Not that they will have to.

Comey Of Errors

Because the first article of impeachment is likely to center around the firing former FBI director James Comey.

Let’s recap a little.

President Nixon’s fall had little to do with the actual break-in of the Watergate hotel. It was the attempted cover-up that followed that brought him down. Obstruction of Justice is a serious offense. It easily fits the impeachment tagline of high crimes and misdemeanors. It is also, at its core, the definitive demarcation highlighting the boundary between presidential power and the rule of law. It’s not an impeachable offense. It’s the impeachable offense.

Did Trump obstruct justice? Who honestly knows?

How could we find out for sure?

Well, we could have a trial I guess.









It looks like that might be Trump’s guess too. His terror of being impeached prompted him to repeatedly seek reassurance from Comey that he was not under investigation. Despite his insistence that the whole thing is fake, he’s busily assembling a legal team headed up by longtime legal adviser Marc Kasowitz.

He’s worried all right.

And he should be. Because the level of distraction, the level of scrutiny and distrust, the sheer damage to American political stability is simply not sustainable. Something has to give.

Either the scandal goes.

Or he does.

Midsummer Night’s Scheme

“Can we have a crisis-free day? That’s all I’m asking.”

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) begged reporters on her way to a working group on a possible Senate health care bill. That such pleading comes from within Trump’s own party is surprising enough. That it should come during what should be a honeymoon period must be a real kick in the dick.

And yet, it makes sense when one realizes that Capitol Hill beats to the rhythm of a very strict timetable. It beats like the pulsing of an athlete’s heart. The tattoo is predictable, steady, almost military in its precision. And it has little patience for the petulant caterwauling of an egomaniac hopped up on his own sense of magnificence. Because Trump isn’t simply getting things wrong; he’s not just out of step with the pulse of government.

He is testing the patience of even the most jaded members of congress.

Little wonder then that his White House leaks like a diaperless baby in a wind tunnel. Each tidbit released to the press is a cry for help. Each anonymous phone call is a message in a bottle cast into the ocean from the bleach clean deck of the USS Unconstitutional:

‘Help,’ the note reads. ‘Madman at the tiller. Great loss of life anticipated. Send aid soon.’

How much longer can Congress ignore the red flags flapping in the wind?

The answer is not much longer.

Now, sure, conventional wisdom suggests that Trump is immune from impeachment thanks to the GOP control of Congress and it’s true, he is somewhat protected by partisan mathematics.

But only somewhat.

Because the midterm elections are coming.

Taming Of The Screw (up.)

Attempts to block impeachment in the House — assuming enough evidence can be gathered to warrant such a move –would be the political equivalent of playing Russian roulette with a fully loaded automatic pistol. The specter of impeachment would be left hanging in limbo. Democrats dangling it before their Republican counterparts like some green-topped sword of Damocles would have a field day. Buried deep in the American political consciousness it would fester and scheme; a coiled spring filled to the brim with potential energy.

Waiting to burst free the moment the ballot box was opened up again.

The GOP would pay a price for that, and they know it.

One Republican strategist who spoke to the Washington Examiner on the condition of anonymity had this to say:

“The concern of people like us is that this investigation will drag on and pop on us in October of 2018, and totally screw us.”

Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Penn., a key Trump ally on Capitol Hill also had his mind fixated on October, admitting that he didn’t:

“Like the idea that this could be strung out, strung out, strung out, strung out.” Or that it could become a “Really big distraction.”

A midterm mauling might give Democrats control of both the House and the Senate. Incumbents and fresh faces alike would be more than happy to place promises of impeachment front and center of their election bids.

Vote for me. (Lock him up.)

So from the perspective of the House rank and file passing the buck might start to look attractive? Why not let the Senate deal with it in 2017 where the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump offers him more protection?

That’s the smart play.

Yet here too there are issues.

Twelfth Nightmare

The idea that an impeachment trial in the senate might be a going concern during the run-up to the midterm elections must be giving Republican Senators the kind of gastric reflux that only an all-chalk diet could get on top of. Of even greater discomfort must be the thought of the trial spilling over into October 2018. In such a scenario senate numbers might shift inexorably in favor of a conviction via popular mandate.

I mean, who wouldn’t want to vote more Democrats on to the jury?

At any rate, senate trials are not brief affairs.

The 1905 impeachment of Florida District Judge Charles Swayne consumed nearly three months of the Senate schedule before it ended on February 27. The impeachment of Bill Clinton also took several months to complete. Trump’s fall from grace could take even longer perhaps as long as 12 months. Twelve months of watching him attempt to cling on to power like a tick on a buffalo’s nutsack would give anyone nightmares.

All of which leaves GOP with less wiggle room than an Errol Flynn jock strap.

If Trump is to be impeached by a GOP-dominated House then, it has to be done by around August 2018 at the absolute latest. And even that would be cutting it fine. Trump supporters would still be sporting the angry scar left by a ‘Trumpopsy’ foisted upon them without warning or anesthetic. The new president would barely have time to draft a speech insisting that the time for unity was upon us. The stock market would be in free fall.

The factories in China would still be churning out ‘Make America Great Again,’ hats.

Winter’s Tale

No, an impeachment taking place over Christmas 2017 to be resolved sometime in February would make much more sense.

Such timing would give an acquitted Trump the opportunity to miss the opportunity to heal old wounds by resorting to the bouts of odious gloating, vicious name calling and juvenile revenge tweets. Were he convicted, the newly elevated President Pence would have time to flex his executive muscles, say a silent prayer for his fellow (heterosexual) Americans and then roll up his sleeves and get stuck into the heady task of legislating the hell out of American uteri.

A second strategic advantage is also easy to spot. If Pence gets dragged into the scandal then he too risks impeachment. The next in line for the presidency is, of course, Paul Ryan, in his capacity as Speaker of the House. Come October 2018 a recently spayed GOP House might see current minority leader Nancy Pelosi as third in line to the Presidency.

The longer the GOP wait, the better things will be for the Democrats.

Which is why Trump is going to resign sometime before Christmas.

Trump’s Labors Lost

I know, a resignation might seem like an odd option for a man who is quick to tell people that he is one of life’s greatest winners but the truth is that Trump has a long history of quitting. He quit Foreman University after only two years was and was only admitted to Wharton as a special favor from a “friendly” admissions officer.

His entire business model is also based on the idea of abandoning any project that doesn’t meet expectations.

Trump Steaks, Trump Magazine, Trump Vodka. They all came to nothing.

Even Trump’s beloved Casino only managed to stay open for just over a year before filing for bankruptcy. And that was despite his daddy bailing him out with the illegal purchase of $3.5 million worth of gaming chips.

He exhibits a similar pattern of behavior when it comes to settling lawsuits. He talks tough.

And then he folds.

When news broke that Trump was being sued by former students of Trump University — a class action that involved over 6000 plaintiffs — Trump responded in a typically bombastic way. Speaking during a debate with his Republican primary opponents, he dismissed the idea that there was anything to the case or that he would settle it, stating:

“I don’t settle cases. I don’t do it because that’s why I don’t get sued very often, because I don’t settle, unlike a lot of other people.” He added, “You know what, let’s see what happens in court.”

He settled.

Indeed, according to New York state attorney general Eric Schneiderman, Trump agreed to a:

“$25 million settlement in the lawsuits against Trump University.”

Something Schneiderman described as being:

“A stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.”

The Merchant Of Menace

Not that this was an isolated incident. Over the past three decades, Trump has been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions in federal and state courts which according to USA Today oscillated from:

“Skirmishes with casino patrons to million-dollar real estate suits to personal defamation lawsuits.”

A breakdown of how each day in court went for Trump is not possible within the confines of this article but a brief analysis reveals the following. In the 1300 or so cases where the record establishes the outcome:

Trump won 450, had around 500 of them dismissed, lost 38 and settled 175.

Like I said, he talks tough.

And then he folds.

King Smear

His options then are quite limited.

He could just keep calm and carry on.

His presidency would continue to be undermined by scandal. He would continue to get little or no credit for anything he does. Beset by leaks and crippled by his own narcissistic personality disorder he would stagger on through day after miserable day, overworked, underappreciated and lacking the wit to comprehend the complexities of a job he thought would be easy.

And his reward?

Articles of impeachment written up by members of his own party. A public trial in which the outcome is by no means certain. A trial with a jury that consisted of people he has casually insulted — on multiple occasions — in the crassest ways imaginable.

He would be forced to face Senator John McCain, a war veteran whose record he openly mocked. Sitting beside him there would be Senator Ted Cruz, a man who had to endure Trump questioning his citizenship, attacking his wife and suggesting that his own father assassinated President Kennedy. And then there would be Senator Marco Rubio or ‘Little Marco’ as Trump used to call him. During the campaign, Rubio was mercilessly mocked by Trump via podium jibes such as:

” I have never seen a human being sweat like this man sweats. … It looked like he had just jumped into a swimming pool with his clothes on.”

And tweets such as:

Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action. #RobotRubio pic.twitter.com/HJWJeoZn4o — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2016

And these are just his Republican enemies.

Richard The Worst

The decision to resign the presidency is not one that anyone — least of all Donald Trump — would take lightly. Richard Nixon looked like he might hang on to the bitter end and when he resigned, he did so only because he understood the reality that faced him. Congress was going to impeach him and then they were going to convict him.

The possibility that he might not even escape prison must have crossed his mind.

It might be crossing Trump’s too.

Mike Pence can probably be relied upon to offer Trump and his co-conspirators a full pardon for any actions they might have been found guilty of. Can the same be said of President Ryan? As the only living example of a human invertebrate, one might assume that he would most definitely do the wrong thing. Then again, Trump has put him through hell and at the point where Ryan took over the White House, probably ruined his political career for all time.

And as for Pelosi? In the unlikely event that she found herself in the White House, a pardon for Trump would be political suicide.

The summer of scandals will drag on. The appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel will ensure that the facts come out. Leaks, revelations, bits of juicy gossip; GOP congressmen will take a good hard look at their calendars, do some sums in their heads and then flee the president’s side like startled flies from a freshly laid turd.

All’s Swell That Ends This Hell

If Trump recognizes that the writing is on the wall then resignation might not sound like such a bad deal. He could spend his twilight years insisting that he had done a tremendous job. Or that the Senate would have acquitted him so fast it would have made our heads spin. His days could be filled with misspelled tweets and cameo appearances in bad movies. His memoirs would find a place in history as the best-selling ‘Vestra Culpa’ whine-fest ever written.

He could get his old life of hookers and golf back again. He could eat in restaurants he does not own. Nobody would care if he refused to read intel reports and nobody would have to worry that he was going to reveal the location of U.S. nuclear submarines to ostensibly hostile powers.

Best of all, a resignation prior to or during the investigation would all but guarantee that Trump would not have to do any prison time.

And that’s got to be a good thing. Because after just one night in prison.

He’d be everyone’s bitch.

By any standard, Donald Trump’s presidency is tanking. As of Tuesday night, FiveThirtyEight pegs his average approval rating at 39.1 percent. Even at this stage, when a president with approval ratings that low, it’s time to call a code. Moreover, the furor over the firing of James Comey and the questions about his campaign’s links to Russia have spurred talk that he may have crossed into impeachment territory.









But to hear the religious right talk, it’s a lot of fuss over nothing. After all, Trump supposedly has the only vote that counts–that of Almighty God himself. Indeed, God was supposedly so determined to put Trump in office that he was the one who hacked the election for Trump, not the Kremlin. Recently, one of the most fanatically pro-Trump fundies told his followers that God is not about to let that work be undone, even in the face of the first calls for his removal.

Lance Wallnau has been one of the loudest fundie cheerleaders for the Donald. During the campaign, he declared that Trump had a “mantle” to win, and his victory would give Christians unprecedented influence over the cultural realm. Specifically, it would give Christians a golden chance to win control over the “Seven Mountains,” or forces, that influence the culture. Wallnau believes that Christians must gain control over those mountains in order to pave the way for Jesus’ return. He is one of the main intellectual forces behind the New Apostolic Reformation, an overtly fascist offshoot of the religious right that believes it can bring about the Second Coming by taking over the world and trampling any opposition standing in its way.

In the last three months, Wallnau has joined the rest of the religious right in trying to warn those against opposing Trump. He has peddled a number of explanations. Supposedly, witchcraft and the “progressive spirit” are one and the same, and that spirit is being fed by the media, who are taking advantage of the fact that a lot of people don’t have a proper “filter” on their brains.

He doubled down on this line in a Facebook message to his followers on Friday, in which he scoffed at any talk of Trump not surviving a full term. People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch got a clip.

Wallnau harrumphed that Trump was only facing so much opposition because “people are crazy in this country.” He had predicted that everyone “from the pink hats to the foil hats to the crazy Berkeley activity” was going to try to push Trump out, and all of Trump’s foibles were going to be “amplified and distorted.”









But to hear Wallnau talk, we’re forgetting one thing–Trump got into office with a major assist from God. For that reason, Wallnau believes that God is not about to let Trump fall now.

“This man didn’t have a miracle getting him into office only to have him removed by what’s happening right now. So the quick word for you is he’s not going to be going anywhere.”

So why are Trump’s ratings tanking? Well, it’s because there’s a hydra-headed serpent spirit called “Leviathan” that “twists the meaning of words”–including Trump’s tweets. The only way to combat it is for more Christians to “be a force” in the mountains of media and government so they can sever the heads of Leviathan. He doesn’t think it’s an accident that Leviathan lives in a swamp.

He then claimed that even if Trump colluded with Russia and/or leaked material to the Kremlin, he didn’t break any laws. Never mind that it raises a question about whether he’s fit for office. That detail doesn’t matter–to Wallnau’s mind, the stink being raised about it is the Leviathan spirit at work–and therefore, “Trump’s not going anywhere.” To that end, he led his followers in prayer.

“In the name of Jesus, Father, I pray that you break the heads of Leviathan over media and political intrigue, that you’ll drain the swamp and that you’ll hit the establishment Republicans that are working to sabotage the president.”

He also prayed for Republican congressmen getting cold feet over Trump’s falling ratings, as well as for “backbone and strength” in the evangelicals who voted for Trump.

So let’s see if we’ve got this right. The millions of people who voted for Hillary, as well as those who now regret voting for Trump, are just crazy. The furor over Comey’s memo saying Trump tried to get him to end the investigation into Michael Flynn? It’s Leviathan at work. All the talk that he may have fired Comey to derail the Russia investigation? It’s Leviathan. The effect on Trump’s approval ratings? It’s Leviathan. And on, and on, and on.

These aren’t just alternative facts, folks. This is an alternative universe. As bad as Trump’s approval ratings are, the only reason he’s even at 39 percent is because white evangelicals still back him by well over 70 percent. I’d wondered how that was possible. Now I have part of my answer.

At first glance, the most telling anecdote of the Republican mentality in recent weeks came when Lindsey Graham–normally one of the more reasonable Republicans in Washington–suggested it was time to take another look at Hillary Clinton’s emails. But there’s an even more telling anecdote that hasn’t been talked about. That is, the near-total silence from the GOP regarding one of the most outrageous moves by an elected official in recent memory–Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen’s ham-handed and childish intimidation of one of his constituents.









In case you missed it, Frelinghuysen, the congressman from New Jersey’s 11th District and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, was really upset over the role of Saily Avelenda in NJ 11th for Change, a group that wants him to hold an in-person town hall in his northern New Jersey district. How upset was he? When Frelinghuysen found out that Avelenda worked as an assistant general counsel at a bank where one of his donors was on the board, he wrote that board member to warn him that Avelenda was “one of the ringleaders” opposing the GOP agenda. The ensuing pressure ultimately forced Avelenda to resign.

In the absence of something we haven’t heard or seen, this has been the response from the House Republican leadership in the week since this story broke.

We already knew that all the GOP talk about “draining the swamp” was hot air. But the silence from Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, and Steve Scalise on Frelinghuysen’s outrageous behavior proves it beyond any doubt. They talk so much about the need for government to be accountable. And yet, a congressman targets one of his constituents for insisting that he be accountable, and no one bothers to speak up?

The silence is equally deafening at the state level. No prominent New Jersey Republican has spoken up to condemn Frelinghuysen’s behavior. That includes his most famous constituent, Governor Chris Christie. For those who don’t know, Christie lives in Morris County, in the heart of Frelinghuysen’s district. I know what you may be thinking–it’s far too much to ask Christie to speak out against this. After all, he almost certainly fostered the environment that made Bridgegate possible. But if Christie wanted to correct that impression, surely he would have spoken up here.

Even by Republican standards, the hypocrisy is staggering. It’s even more so when you consider that Frelinghuysen’s actions represent a fundamental breach of one of the most sacred principles in a democracy–that no one should have to fear that their government will retaliate against them for speaking out. This was underlined at NJ 11th for Change’s weekly rally at Frelinghuysen’s office in Morristown. Many of the attendees sported buttons saying “I Am A Ringleader” in solidarity with Avelenda.

Anyone who thinks that they were making a lot of fuss over nothing should read what one of the attendees, Marion Jacobson, told the (Morristown) Daily Record.

“We’re here to rally by her side and support her as friends, but we’re also here to let Rodney Frelinghuysen know he has overstepped. Who is next? What other NJ 11th members has he Googled to see where they work? Why hasn’t he apologized yet? He’s hiding behind a wall of silence to protect himself from accusations of being unethical.”

No one in any self-respecting democracy should have to live with that fear. Not now, not ever. Since no elected Republican has seen fit to condemn this for the pigweed that it is, I have to assume–sadly–that they at the very least willing to look the other way.









For the last two years, I’d wondered–how in the world was it possible for Donald Trump to remain in the race despite his numerous outrages on the campaign trail? Well, now I have at least part of my answer. The same mentality that made it possible for what passes for leadership in the GOP to remain silent about a congressman who found it acceptable to bully a constituent in this way is the same mentality that allowed them to look the other way at a presidential candidate who plastered a private cell phone number on social media.

Frelinghuysen could potentially face tough sledding for a 12th term in 2018. He’s running in a district that Trump won by the skin of his teeth, 49-48. According to a recent poll by Monmouth University, only 34 percent of Americans who live in districts where the margin between Trump and Hillary Clinton was in the single digits approve of Trump’s performance. Normally, it takes a unique set of circumstances to defeat an Appropriations Committee chairman. However, if these numbers hold, there’s a very good chance that Frelinghuysen will pay the ultimate political price for treating Avelenda in this way. The Democrats already have a solid candidate in the race, former federal prosecutor and Navy pilot Mikie Sherrill; send her some love here.

But we shouldn’t have to wait that long. When a congressman finds it even remotely acceptable to target a constituent in this way, it’s time for that congressman to go–now. Sign this petition to tell Frelinghuysen to resign immediately. If there’s any justice, a lot of Republicans should follow him out the door–if not now, certainly next November. Their silence on a breach of one of the most basic trusts in our democracy should leave no doubt–the Republican Party, in its present form, is unfit to govern.

I know that there are a lot of Republicans who would probably be outraged that any lawmaker, regardless of party, would behave in this way. Well, guys, you have some cleaning to do. If we’re to heal the division in this country, we not only have to get rid of the Frelinghuysens of this world, but also those who look the other way when they think they can treat their constituents this way. It’s a job that should have been done a long time ago. But it needs to start now, on both sides of the aisle.

Among the religious right leaders who are still bowing to Donald Trump, Rick Joyner is in a class by himself. He was one of the first prominent fundies to warn against opposing Trump. Initially, he tried to explain that those raising their voices against the Donald were driven by witchcraft and the devil himself. He has since warned us that God still has favor on Trump, and for that reason we risk getting “smacked” by God himself if we oppose him.









How loyal is Joyner to Trump? He actually claimed that Trump was within his rights to fire James Comey. Apparently, he believes that trying to get to the bottom of a foreign government interfering in our election is “majoring on minors.”

Even in the face of this, he still believes God has his hand on Trump–and is about to prove it by opening the trap door under his foes. Well, on Friday, Joyner delivered another warning to Trump’s foes–if they try to impeach Trump, they risk triggering a domino effect that will ultimately lead to martial law.

Joyner took to Facebook while en route to a vacation on the Gulf Coast, and peddled more alternative facts about Trump’s cratering popularity. People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch got a clip.

Joyner repeated his delusion from a few days earlier–the Comey furor is actually going to help Trump because “it’s illuminating where people are.” For instance, it’s making liberals and the media look crazy and lose credibility. Supposedly, every time Trump is attacked, “he ends up winning every time.” If he’s still winning, Rick, then why are his approval ratings averaging at 38.8 percent?









But Joyner claims that Trump has the only vote that counts. After all, “there’s a favor on him,” and he’s been “ordained with a purpose” and has “divine protection.” He then repeated a prediction he made in 2013–there is going to be martial law in this country. However, he believes that it may take martial law to get this country “back on the rails.”

He then suggested one thing that could potentially trigger martial law–if Trump is impeached and removed.

“If the left, let’s just say, they were able to overthrow a legally elected president, it would be unbelievable, I think, what would happen in America. I think martial law would have to step in. Like him or not … and Trump is never going to win a popularity contest, he’s not that kind of leader. But like him or not, like it or not, he was constitutionally elected. And and those who are trying to overthrow his presidency by all of these devices and lies that they’re putting out—the media and everyone—this is sedition!”

I had to listen to this twice to believe it. So in Joyner’s eyes, even if there is uncontestable evidence that Trump obstructed justice by attempting to throw the Russia investigation sideways, impeachment and removal would be a sign that the country has completely lost its bearings–and the only way to regain them would be a military coup.

Once again, Joyner betrays a dangerous misunderstanding of how our government works. When a president engages in gross abuse of power or criminal conduct, the strongest check on that president is impeachment. When used properly, impeachment does not circumvent democracy. Far from it–it’s actually democracy in action.

By Joyner’s logic, we should have let Nixon’s abuses slide. He covered up the Watergate burglary, and used the power of his office to trample on free speech. But none of that should have mattered. After all, he won 49 states. Attempting to remove him from office would have amounted to overthrowing a legally elected president. See where this is going?

But then again, Joyner really doesn’t believe in democracy. He is one of the leading voices of the New Apostolic Reformation, an overtly fascist offshoot of the religious right that believes it can bring about the Second Coming by taking over the world. In a 2007 post at Elijah List, an NAR-aligned ministry site, Joyner openly admitted that the kind of government he wants to set up would look a little–okay, a lot–like a dictatorship.

Joyner tipped his hand when he declared that Trump was well within his rights to tell Comey to shut down the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn–and thus disregard longstanding safeguards against White House interference in active investigations. Now he’s openly calling for a military coup if Trump is impeached, since getting rid of Trump would betray democracy.

No, Rick. If Trump indeed broke the law, allowing him to stay in would be a betrayal of democracy. But then again, you don’t really believe in democracy anyway.

President Donald Trump couldn’t have won without the xenophobic vote. Which makes his support of radical Islamic terrorism all the more interesting.









Radical Islam

Trump ran his campaign on making America first. Racists flocked to his rallies in droves, eager to see that white supremacy was finally being normalized.

He even said:

“Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”

Yet last month, the CIA quietly restored their Train and Equip program in Syria. While they claim it’s to support “moderate” Syrian rebels, it’s been proven there’s no such thing as a “moderate” rebel.









It’s all the Islamic State.

Former President Barack Obama originally did this program in an attempt to destabilize the Syrian government. Thanks to Trump’s love of Twitter, his 2013 tweet about staying out of Syria has been making the rounds:

We should stop talking, stay out of Syria and other countries that hate us, rebuild our own country and make it strong and great again-USA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2013

Four years and one amazing piece of chocolate cake later, and we’re knee deep in Syria.

ISIS

Trump built up and has maintained his voter base by fueling Islamophobia. In fact, hate crimes against Muslims have been on the rise since he was elected into office. It’s no secret that most of his supporters hated Obama because he was Black.

During the campaign last year, Trump even claimed that Obama was the founder of ISIS. Naturally that turned a few heads. He was later asked if he meant Obama created it inadvertently.

Trump replied:

“No, I meant he’s the founder of ISIS. I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.”

So it would seem as though Trump wants nothing to do with Islam. He would rather focus on Making America Great and White Again, to try and get a Muslim ban passed and to let Syria take care of itself.

Just when you thought Trump couldn’t be more hypocritical, he restarts the Train and Equip program to help radical Islamic terrorism.

As of Saturday afternoon, Donald Trump’s average approval rating, as computed by FiveThirtyEight, stands at 38.8 percent–the lowest on record for a president at this stage in his administration. But the only reason it’s even that high is because the religious right continues to bow before him. Polls show that anywhere from 73 to 78 percent of white evangelicals approve of Trump’s performance–more than double the national average.









It’s mainly because a significant segment of what passes for leadership on the religious right have convinced their followers that any opposition to Trump is influenced by witchcraft and demons, and that God still has favor on Trump despite all of his outrages. Indeed, one prominent fundie claims that those who oppose Trump risk getting “smacked” by God himself–and that God is about to smack most of Trump’s enemies even in the midst of the furor over the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Another claims that those who oppose Trump risk bringing a curse on themselves and their families.

As nauseating as this is, a hypercharismatic evangelist from Denmark with a growing following on this side of the Atlantic is engaging in something that may be even more outrageous. How do you get more outrageous than pushing your followers to support Trump with a mix of alternative facts and fear? Very easily, as it turns out–by making people think that autism is demonic. He’s due to peddle that message this summer and fall in the United States.

Back in 2011, baker-turned evangelist Torben Sondergaard was at the end of his tether when a man for whom he prayed was healed and no longer had to make regular visits to the hospital. It eventually led him to form a movement he calls “The Last Reformation,” based in the north Danish city of Aalborg. He bills it as an effort to return the church to “the simple disciple life” led by the early Christians. As he sees it, that life includes returning to the gospel–which in his reading means being baptized in water and being baptized in the Holy Spirit with evidence of speaking in tongues. That tenet puts him way outside mainstream charismatic/Pentecostal thinking.









It also includes teaching people to pray for the sick and cast out demons–or as he calls it, “kickstarting” them. Here’s an example from 2015 in the UK.

At first glance, this is just another fringe charismatic outfit, no different than the crazy that we usually see on Trinity Broadcasting Network, Daystar, God TV, and the like. But in 2016, Sondergaard’s act stopped being a laughing matter. In January 2016, he took to Facebook with a giddy post about what happened in Australia earlier in the day.

That post, and an accompanying Facebook video, came back to haunt Sondergaard a few months later. He was due to travel to Ireland, where his movement had already acquired a substantial following, for a “kickstarting” seminar in Dublin. By April, autism advocacy groups across Ireland and the UK had seen his claims to have cast a demon out of that autistic girl, and were up in arms.

Fiona O’Leary of Autism Rights Together, who is autistic herself and has two autistic children, called any suggestion that autism was demonic “very damaging” and “just terrible.” Her organization had been working to get unregulated treatments for autism outlawed, and she saw Sondergaard as a perfect reason why that law was necessary. Her concerns were echoed by Adam Harris of AsIAm.ie, who accused Sondergaard of giving people the false hope that “autism is something that can be cured,” and of preying on people “at a very vulnerable stage in their lives.”

When confronted about these concerns in Barcelona, where he was holding a “kickstart” prior to coming to Ireland, Sondergaard said that he could not cure autism. However, he said, he did free that Australian girl from the “demons” that caused her ordeal.

When the criticism continued unabated, Sondergaard accused his critics of being Pharisees. No, this isn’t snark.

I first heard of Sondergaard in March, and was initially intrigued, being a charismatic/Pentecostal Christian myself. But when I saw him claim that autism could even potentially be demonic, I was appalled. This goes well beyond the usual “demon under every rock” mentality that is all too common in fringe charismatic outfits. By even suggesting that autism is demonic, Sondergaard could be keeping kids under his influence from getting badly needed care and a better quality of life. Apparently it hasn’t occurred to him that God can work through medicine just as well as he can through a miraculous healing.

Even in the face of this, Sondergaard has become quite the celebrity in some charismatic circles. This crackpot message is coming to the United States very soon. In early June, two people trained by his team are holding a “kickstart” in Los Angeles. This fall, Sondergaard himself is coming to Asheville, North Carolina for a “Pioneer Training School” from September 24 to October 15, at which attendees will get hands-on training on healing the sick and casting out demons.

Sondergaard has a decent-sized following in the United States and Canada; a look at a worldwide map of Last Reformation followers reveals a virtual forest of gray pushpins for followers and orange pushpins for recommended contact people. It’s hard to believe his following here in North America would be anywhere near that large had more people known about his dangerous claims about autism. The mere thought that kids in both Los Angeles and Asheville could be told that they have demons in them should send a chill down anyone’s spine.

This is yet another case of what happens when the American press drops the ball on a major international story. But now that we know what this quack and crackpot is preaching, we can put him on notice that we will expose him. Let him know what you think of his hurtful teachings on his personal Facebook page, as well as the Last Reformation’s official Facebook page. Let them have it on Twitter as well.

Most of us know that the firing of FBI Director James Comey has turned into an unmitigated disaster for Donald Trump. After all, we now have solid confirmation that the stated reason for his firing–the manner in which he handled the Hillary Clinton email probe–is false.









If that wasn’t enough, this week word got out that Comey himself wrote in a memo about a meeting with Trump that the president wanted him to snuff out an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Combine that with the prospect that Trump only used the memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as a pretext to derail the investigation into Russia’s interference in the election, and we could potentially have two cases of obstruction of justice.

So who could possibly think this situation is a good thing for Trump? Well, one of Trump’s most fanatical supporters on the religious right, Rick Joyner, apparently does. On Thursday, he told his Facebook followers that God is actually using the furor over Comey’s ouster to pull the rug out from under Trump’s foes. People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch got a clip.

Joyner previously warned those who oppose Trump that they risk getting “smacked” by God himself for standing against the Donald. Apparently he believes a major “smacking” is unfolding before our eyes.

To hear Joyner talk, liberals and the media think “they’ve got Trump on the run.” They don’t know, however, that they’re walking into a trap–one set by God himself.

“I believe we have someone even bigger who is setting things up in our country–that it is God himself who is responding to the prayers of his people and Trump is being used in an incredible way. And I think we are going to see everything turned around.”

Joyner added that Trump has always come back “with a bigger victory than ever” every time it looked like he was done for. To his mind, it’s a sign that God has a “divine purpose” for Trump. Given Trump’s numerous comebacks, it’s clear to Joyner that “he’s got somebody looking out for him right now.”









For that reason, Joyner is confident that both the Comey and Russia controversies will “go away”–but not before God opens the trap door under Trump’s opponents.

“You can’t really take out your enemies until you see them. And I think it’s being proven where everybody in our Congress and everyone, what their true state is, their true nature is.”

It only took 24 hours for us to know beyond any doubt that Joyner was blowing smoke. On Friday afternoon, we learned that the Russia investigation is focusing on, among other things, a senior member of Trump’s inner circle. And apparently something has White House lawyers scared enough that they are already researching the impeachment process, even though–for now–they think that prospect is still remote.

Just before that story broke, the first series of approval rating polls taken entirely after this week’s scandals broke were factored into FiveThirtyEight’s average. All of them showed Trump’s approval ratings in the high 30s to mid-40s–all very low, even for this early stage. It was enough to send Trump’s average approval rating down to 38.9 percent, a new record low for any president at this point in his administration. All things considered, this sounds like another dose of alternative facts from one of the many religious right leaders who have been serving up alternative facts by the bushel to their followers in order to keep them bowing before the Orange Calf.

Well, not entirely. Joyner may be right about one thing–a trap door may be about to open after all. The only problem is that he and the other religious right leaders who enabled Trump may be the ones walking on top of it, and they don’t even know it. As abysmal as Trump’s approval ratings are now, the only reason they’re even that high is because well over 70 percent of white evangelicals still approve of Trump’s performance, even in the face of the many outrages that have come from this administration.

A number of my radical-lefty charismatic friends have believed for some time that Trump is being used to expose the religious right and teach them a sobering lesson–God won’t honor just anything or anyone with an “R” next to it. The way things are going, that lesson is about to be learned in full. And Joyner himself may have tacitly admitted it.

You know it’s bad when a member of your own party rips you to shreds. Especially when it’s done in a piece called When The World Is Led by a Child.









Fidgety

David Brooks is a conservative political commentator for the New York Times. He recently penned a scathing op-ed against our Toddler in Chief and pointed out, among other things, three disturbing qualities about President Donald Trump.

For starters, he’s fidgety.

Just like all dog owners should teach their pups how to sit and stay, most adults have mastered this by the age of 25. Not Trump, though.

Brooks says:

“First, most adults have learned to sit still. But mentally, Trump is still a 7-year-old boy who is bouncing around the classroom.”

Ouch.

He points out that you can see this in the way he gives interviews. Each question is given a short response before he goes on to cover another four or five topics. He’s all over the place and can’t stay focused.

Down boy, down. Sit. Stay. Good doggy.

Insecure

Brooks goes on to say that by the time someone can legally drink, they should have developed their own merit system. A moral code, if you will.

Trump has been able to legally drink for quite some time now, so surely he’s secure with himself. There’s just no way that America would have elected a president who needs a reward after everything he says or does.

Except we did.









Trump loves to fluff himself up to cover up the fact that he doesn’t know what the fuck he’s doing. He once said to Time magazine:

“In a short period of time I understood everything there was to know about healthcare.”

Except he’s proven that he doesn’t know shit about healthcare.

Theory of Mind

Another sign of adulthood is developing a theory of mind. It’s the ability to pick up on how others are feeling or what they’re thinking. As Brooks points out, Trump lacks this skill. He said:

“But Trump seems to have not yet developed a theory of mind. Other people are black boxes that supply either affirmation or disapproval.”

He goes on to say that because of this, Trump is transparent. If the reports of him leaking secrets to Russia are true, it’s probably because he just wants to be their buddy.

All of this makes for an extremely incompetent leader. But then again, her emails…

Many conservatives have actually said:

“I wouldn’t watch Rachel Maddow if you paid me.”

A new study in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology tested this very question.

The study told people that they would get a chance to win $10 if they read an opposing opinion on a topic. They would get a chance to win $7 if they chose the opinion that they already agreed with. The given topic was same-sex marriage.









A whopping 63-percent of the participants chose to stick with what they already agreed with, even though the amount offered was higher for reading the opposing point of view.

Jeremy Frimer, the University of Winnipeg psychologist who led the study, says:

“They don’t know what’s going on the other side, and they don’t want to know.”









Is Hearing An Opposing View As Bad As Getting A Tooth Pulled?

The study authors asked participants to rate hearing opposing viewpoints compared to other activities such as watching paint dry or having a tooth pulled.

The participants didn’t rate listening to an opposing opinion to be as bad as getting a tooth pulled, but it was close.

The study concluded that people:

“… Are motivated to avoid hearing from the other side for some of the same reasons: the anticipation of cognitive dissonance and the undermining of a fundamental need for a shared reality with other people.”

The studies also concluded:

“Together with a growing body of evidence suggesting that increased knowledge and expertise in a topic area exacerbates rather than ameliorates political bias, the prognosis for eradicating partisan bias with harder data and better education does not seem particularly rosy.”

We need to find an answer to make opposing viewpoints easier to consume. Facebook can help in this arena. We have to do more than just delete factually inaccurate posts. Maybe it will take more than $3 extra to get people to listen to opposing viewpoints. This is a battle against the tendencies of the human brain.

“Together with a growing body of evidence suggesting that increased knowledge and expertise in a topic area exacerbates rather than ameliorates political bias, the prognosis for eradicating partisan bias with harder data and better education does not seem particularly rosy.”

We need to find an answer to make opposing viewpoints easier to consume. Facebook can help in this arena. We have to do more than just delete factually inaccurate posts. Maybe it will take more than $3 extra to get people to listen to opposing viewpoints. This is a battle against the tendencies of the human brain.

When talk of climate change and rising temperatures first came to light, some people argued that it was just a natural fluctuation in global temperatures.









As time went on, scientists began to gather more evidence of increasing global temperatures. They gathered information on how human activities are impacting the atmosphere. Slowly, but surely, the evidence rolled in until virtually every professional science organization in the world came to understand that climate change is real. And that human activities are a huge contributor.









But as we all know, even though the recognition of climate change goes all the way back to the mid 1880’s, there are still people who refuse to admit it’s real.

People like our current President, who once called the whole thing a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.

And people like Congressman Tim Walberg, Republican of Michigan. This elected official told his constituents last week then he does believe in climate change. He just isn’t sure that humans are responsible.

Then he said something so completely delusional that you have to wonder about his connection to reality. He said this:

“I believe there’s climate change. I believe there’s been climate change since the beginning of time. I believe there are cycles. Do I think man has some impact? Yeah, of course. Can man change the entire universe? No. Why do I believe that? Well, as a Christian, I believe that there is a creator in God who is much bigger than us. And I’m confident that, if there’s a real problem, he can take care of it.”

Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you read that correctly. This…person…says that the U.S. doesn’t need to worry about silly things like reducing our carbon emissions or switching to renewable energy. Heck, no! See, in his delusional little brain, God will take care of it!

Obviously, Congressman Walberg has either never heard of the African drought that has killed hundreds of thousands of humans. Either that or he thinks that God has a preference for white Americans and doesn’t mind all the horror that is hitting black African families.

This is the kind of thing that makes some of us wonder if humans are actually the most valuable species on this planet.

After informing G7 leaders he will make a “final decision on the Paris accord next week,” President Donald Trump took exactly one day to conclude cutting domestic greenhouse gas emissions 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 is simply not worth it.









Denial is not a river in Egypt, but if it were, it would be rising at pace with its other aqueous counterparts due to man-made climate change.

So while President Trump is digging in his intransigent heels over a “Chinese hoax,” we need not look any further for climate change’s exigencies than our Alaskan brothers and sisters confronting effects of three record-breaking years of warmth following decades of rising temperatures, sea levels, and melting permafrost.

Residents of coastal Alaskan villages have for years watched the sea gradually devour their towns or cause their towns to sink as the permafrost beneath transforms from solid ice into swampland.

The epicenter is Newtok, an Alaska Native village in the Yukon River Delta. Residents have been trying to relocate for decades as permafrost erodes and the nearby Ninglick River eats away at its banks to the tune of 70 feet per year.

Romy Cadiente, the village relocation coordinator, told NPR in January:

“We just need to get out of there for the safety of the 450 people there.”

Newtok’s residents have started building a new village further inland, but they don’t have the $60 million to finish and relocate. Much of Newtok’s infrastructure will be inundated by 2020.

Sally Russell Cox is a community planner overseeing climate adaptation for the Alaska state government. She said:

“We have a plan for doing it, we know all the different components that have to be done and the sequencing for how it has to happen. If there was designated funding for Newtok they’d be done within two years — they’d be completely moved over.”

Alaska’s government is primarily reliant on oil revenue. Plunging prices and production have cast the state’s budget into disarray.

During the Obama administration, Cox was able to receive funds from various departments and agencies, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Commerce Department. The Department of Defense (DOD) sent soldiers-in-training to help begin constructing a new Newtok village. President Barack Obama proposed providing $400 million for Arctic village relocation. Due the Republican-led Congress during most of Obama’s tenure, though, that money never arrived.









A 2009 Government Accountability Office report found that at least twelve of the thirty-one most highly threatened villages hoped to move. Only Newtok has been able to find a suitable location, though.

Kivalina is one example. It is a village on a barrier island 500 miles north of Newtok, inside the Arctic circle. Kivalina residents found a new site to move to, but the Army Corps of Engineers deemed it unsafe.

Kivalina is expected to be underwater within a decade.

The federal government has only to relocate a single community threatened by climate change. In 2016, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded a community on Isle de Jean Charles, La. $50 million to move to safer ground. Alaska also applied but was denied. In January, before the Trump administration took over, Newtok asked the Obama administration for Federal Emergency Management Agency funding, but administration rejected the request, citing the community was not experiencing the type of disaster FEMA was meant to address.

And that’s with a president who took the existential threat of climate change seriously.

With Trump’s flat-out denial climate change even exists, Victoria Herrmann, president and managing director of the Arctic Institute, is not confident this administration will even bother listening to anyone. She said:

“There is no real reason to believe that infrastructure assistance for adaptation or relocation for Alaskan communities — or otherwise — will be made available under an administration that is skeptical of climate change and actively trying to backtrack on any progress made on greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation efforts.”

But Sally Russell Cox isn’t ready to give up on the Trump administration. She said:

“Maybe they’ll take a stance that they’re ok providing assistance to these communities because of erosion and flooding and permafrost degradation, but we don’t want to call it climate change. The impacts are not going to go away, whether you think its climate change or not. The impacts are going to continue to happen and they’re going to continue to need help.”

Trump’s stance against the Paris Climate accord and climate change appears less principled than financial, it seems. He recognizes climate change is a problem when it pertains to his business interests. A case in point is Trump’s battle with the European Union over building sea walls to protect his golf courses from rising sea levels.

According to the Washington Post:

“Trump has cited his tangle over the golf-course wall as Exhibit A in justifying a jaundiced view of the E.U. that puts him at odds with decades of bipartisan U.S. foreign policy.”

Isn’t it supposed to be all about us?

"A new series of bills passing in various states around the country are calling for “academic freedom,” which sounds good and all. However, these bills are being used to teach that creationism and evolution are both equally valid theories.









They want to allow teachers to present all sides of controversial issues such as evolution and climate change. These laws have passed in several states such as Florida, Alabama, and Indiana.

Glenn Branch, deputy director of the National Center for Science Education(NCSE) in Oakland, California, said this about them:

“The strategies of creationists have gotten more sophisticated.”

They are taking a somewhat backdoor approach to this. For example, the Florida law, which passed May 5, 2017, says that any taxpayer can complain about a school’s curriculum. It doesn’t change curriculum that is already in place, but in the event of a complaint, a hearing will be convened to determine if the material is:

“…Accurate, balanced, noninflammatory, current, free of pornography … and suited to students’ needs.”

This sounds like they have good intentions. However, who decides what “balanced” and “noninflammatory” mean?









State Representative Byron Donalds (R-Florida, 80th District), who sponsored the bill, says it’s not anti-science at all. He says he thinks it passed because they didn’t target any one subject specifically. He said:

“One of the key things about this bill, and why I think it passed, is that we didn’t target any one subject matter.

…The people pushing the bill have been complaining about evolution and climate change. It’s obvious that a strong motivation is getting that out of the textbooks.”

There are two main types of “academic freedom” bills that have passed in various states in recent years. One type mandates that teachers should be able to discuss:

“… The full range of scientific views regarding biological and chemical evolution.”

Students are given:

“… Protection for subscribing to a particular position on views regarding biological or chemical evolution.”

Another type allows teachers to discuss:

“… The scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories.”

"We’ve all done battle with the infamous basement-dwelling keyboard warriors on the internet. Many of us have had real life encounters with unbelievably stupid idiots that you just know finished watching Alex Jones and went out to the grocery store looking to edu-ma-cate some librul idgits on the “facts” of real-world politicking. They’re out there, and their arguments are hollow. Here we examine some of their most common fallacies and how to combat them using logic.









We’ve provided examples, how to spot them, and how to counter them:

1. The Straw Man Argument

Let’s start with a text book definition of this type of argument:

“A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent’s argument, while refuting an argument that was not advanced by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ‘attacking a straw man.'”

The idea is to take one concept and oversimplify the argument to make it seem like something its not. Then, as people attempt to use logic to take it down, the attacker just doubles down on the incorrect argument. However, this is not really logic. Check out this example.









Example:

Recently, after the firing of FBI Director James Comey, Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway had an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN. Upon being asked if the firing of Comey was a cover-up, Conway responded:

“He’s wrong, it’s not a coverup. In fact, the president makes very clear in his letter the fact that Mr. Comey on three occasions assured him he is not under investigation.”

When the firing of Comey hit the news, Trump’s spokespeople were ALL claiming that Comey was fired because of his mishandling of the Clinton email scandal. This remained their argument until Trump himself stated that he was indeed fired because of the investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia.

It doesn’t take a master puzzle-solver to put the pieces of this jigsaw puzzle together. We all know that Conway’s statement was false. We all heard Comey state, under oath, that there were indeed active investigations into the ties between the Trump administration and the Russians. Cooper pressed her as the interview continued and her tact was to constantly repeat the false statement until Cooper finally stated:

“I’m not sure that many people believe this doesn’t restore confidence in the FBI. In fact, a lot of people are raising questions about saying that it destroys people’s confidence in the FBI.”

How To Spot:

The straw man attack is usually pretty easy to spot. Simple research will allow all the ammunition needed to knock the argument down. The easiest thing to do is to make sure that the opposition actually made the claim that the attacker is saying they did. In this case, we have a ton of substantive evidence that the president is under investigation.

Just because the president wrote a bizarre paragraph in the letter to Comey announcing his firing doesn’t make that investigation go away:

“While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.”

The straw man being attacked is the Clinton email scandal. Although Comey was fired in a vain attempt to stop the Russia investigation, Trump’s spokespeople were trying to claim that Comey was fired because of the unsuccessful investigation in the emails. When the Russian connection is mentioned, that bizarre paragraph will be brought up and the erroneous claim that Comey assured the president that there was no investigation will be reinforced — and the conversation will be pointed back to the email scandal.

How To Counter:

Since they are easy to spot, they are also pretty easy to counter. Simply ask your opponent for proof and their argument will fall apart quickly. Steer them back to the actual matter, rather than allowing them to continue on the deflection path.

2. The False Dilemma Fallacy

This fallacy involves assuming that there are only two solutions to a problem. RWNJs love to do this. They try to make you think that there are only two solutions to a problem: their solution and the wrong solution. Many problems are not so black and white. Here is one example. Suppose a politician says:

“We have to decide if we are going to support school choice or if we are going to support failing schools.”

This assumes that our only options are supporting for-profit schools or letting public schools fail when there are so many other possibilities.

Republicans have also used this same tact when addressing the healthcare crisis in our country. They maintain that we must repeal the ACA and settle for Trumpcare as opposed to opting for the many other solutions available:

Expand the ACA to include additional coverage and provisions left out of the original

Expand Medicare and convert the ACA to a single-payer system

Expand Medicare and convert it to a universal healthcare system covered by taxes

How To Spot:

Unless there is a logical reason why there would only be two solutions, ask your opponent why he is offering only two options. Chances are they will double-down on the two options, which normally can be classed as “bad” and “worse.”

How To Counter:

Once you have spotted the false dilemma, start asking your opponent about other options, and that will usually shatter their credibility. Be prepared to highlight the other options available and the steps needed to at least begin the process of implementation of the better options.

For instance – it doesn’t do any good to just say “Fund public schools” without emphasizing the benefits that funding public education will bring. Likewise, it doesn’t do any good to just lobby for universal healthcare if you don’t present a plan to achieve your goal.

Go Forth And Do Battle

We’ve only covered the two most common types of arguments used by RWNJs here, but there are many more.

The Appeal to Authority

The Appeal to Fear

The Appeal to the Masses

The Achilles Heal Fallacy

The Ad Hominem Attack

Shifting the Onus of Truth

The Red Herring

We’re not going to elaborate on all of them. You can visit the primary source we started with at Daltonator.net if you want more. The best weapon you can have in your arsenal is KNOWLEDGE. General MacArthur studied Rommel and read Rommel’s book on strategy in order to decimate him on the battlefield. Know your enemy. Know your topic. Stay calm and even-keeled when presenting any counter-argument. You will not win if you allow yourself to get angry. Reason and logic. We must take the high road if we are to regain control of our government and our country.

An ancient plague, frozen beneath the arctic ice for millennia, is suddenly released as the ice around it thaws. The disease makes its ways to civilization, killing billions and bringing civilization to a screeching halt.

It sounds like science fiction. But as climate change accelerates, long-dormant pathogens and bacteria could awaken and wreak havoc across the world.

Bacteria are resilient. Some, ensconced in permafrost, may be able to stay alive for up to a million years. Now that the permafrost is thawing – and at a rate much faster than expected – those bacteria will soon be unleashed. Evolutionary biologist Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille University in France explains:

“Permafrost is a very good preserver of microbes and viruses, because it is cold, there is no oxygen, and it is dark. Pathogenic viruses that can infect humans or animals might be preserved in old permafrost layers, including some that have caused global epidemics in the past.”

In 2014, Claverie revived two viruses that had been trapped in permafrost for 30,000 years. While they couldn’t infect humans, the viruses were infectious to single-celled amoebas. More dangerous viruses might be unearthed as the world warms.









Diseases that killed people and animals that were buried in the permafrost pose another threat. In a 2011 study, Boris Revich and Marina Podolnaya of the Russian Academy of Sciences wrote:

“As a consequence of permafrost melting, the vectors of deadly infections of the 18th and 19th centuries may come back, especially near the cemeteries where the victims of these infections were buried.”

Siberia, for instance, saw a major smallpox outbreak during the 1890s. In one town, about 40 percent of the population died. They were buried on the banks of the Kolyma River. But today, the river’s banks are eroding and the thawing permafrost is accelerating the process.

Unfortunately, deadly diseases aren’t the only problem posed by thawing permafrost. The communities built on permafrost face serious infrastructure challenges as their roads and buildings have begun collapsing. In the early 1990s, thawing permafrost in Siberia opened a massive crater one mile long and 400 feet deep. It’s grown rapidly since.

Permafrost also traps methane, a greenhouse gas with a climate impact 25 times that of carbon dioxide. This methane will soon be released, warming the world even faster and making life on earth all but impossible.

In honor of Earth Day 2017, CNN decided to have a discussion Saturday morning on the topic of climate change, and two of the invited guests were Bill Nye (aka the “Science Guy) and William Happer, a physicist at Princeton University who is an ardent denier of climate change and has also advised Donald Trump on the issue.









Happer started off his comments with blatant lies:

“There’s this myth that’s developed around carbon dioxide that it’s a pollutant, but you and I both exhale carbon dioxide with every breath. Each of us emits about two pounds of carbon dioxide a day, so are we polluting the planet. Carbon dioxide is a perfectly natural gas, it’s just like water vapor, it’s something that plants love. They grow better with more carbon dioxide, and you can see the greening of the earth already from the additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.”

A clearly exasperated Nye responded by criticizing both CNN and Professor Happer:

“What he claims to not understand is the rate. it’s the speed at which we’re adding carbon dioxide. And I will say, much as I love the CNN, you’re doing a disservice by having one climate change skeptic and not 97 or 98 scientists or engineers concerned about climate change.”









Later in the debate, Nye again called Happer out for pretending that climate change is some sort of non-issue:

“I encourage you to cut this out so we can move forward and make the United States a world leader in technology. We want advanced wind turbines, advanced concentrated energy plants. If we were to do that, we would have at least 3 million new jobs in the United States that could not be outsourced. We would not need to have our military on the other of the world defending what people call ‘our oil.’ We could move forward and we could export this technology. We could be world leaders in this instead of wringing our hands and cherry picking data and pretending that this problem that’s obvious to the scientific community but it is somehow not obvious to you.”

But Happer was far from finished making a complete jackass of himself, comparing the 2016 Paris Agreement on the environment to Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Hitler. CNN host Victor Blackwell asked how in the world Happer could make such a statement, to which the completely clueless professor replied:

“It is an appropriate comparison because it was a treaty that was not going to do any good. This treaty also will not do any good. Anyone who looks at the results of doing what the treaty says can see that the effect on the earth’s climate is — even if you take the alarmist computer models, trivial. It will not make any difference and yet it will cause enormous harm to many people.”

And this man calls himself a scientist?! I say we put William Happer out on a ice floe somewhere in Antarctica and not allow him to return until he manages to get all the excrement out from between his ears.

Here’s the segment from CNN:

In the 1960s, America was a dirtier, uglier place than it is today. Illegal dumping was widespread. Sewage often mingled with river water that upstream communities swam in or drank from. And smokestacks stood directly alongside residential developments.









Two catalysts would bring about lasting change and inspire the Environmental Protection Agency. One was Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring. Published in 1962, Silent Spring alerted the public to the dangers of the pesticide DDT and unveiled the petrochemical industry’s dangerous misinformation campaign.

The second was the Cuyahoga River fire in 1969. Time described the state of the Cuyahoga at the time of the fire:

“Some river! Chocolate-brown, oily, bubbling with subsurface gases, it oozes rather than flows.”

When this flammable stew caught fire, it caused $50,000 in damage.

These mounting environmental dangers led to louder calls for government intervention. Finally, Richard Nixon founded the EPA in 1970. Landmark legislation like the Clean Water Act soon followed.

Of course, the EPA didn’t solve every environmental problem in the country. But things could be worse. A lot worse. It’s only because of modern environmental legislation and regulations that we were able to stop tearing the hole in the ozone layer, remove lead from gasoline, and restrict the use of dangerous pesticides.

Today, the hard-won gains achieved by the EPA are under threat. President Donald Trump’s proposed budget dramatically slashes EPA funding, and he’s already installed a known climate denier as the agency’s head.









As one of the world’s largest producers of greenhouse gas, the United States has an obligation to lead on environmental and climate issues. And if we are to avoid returning to the bad old days before the EPA, we need to remind people of what the country used to look like.

You wouldn’t think it would be possible.

I mean, the hilarity factor alone should have prevented this from ever happening.

But life is a funny old thing, right? You just can’t predict what might happen.

A reality TV star with a fake tan might become President of the United States. Anything is possible.

In that vein, let’s take a look at the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum. Kentucky is known for its history of coal mining. The Kentucky Coal Mining Museum is dedicated to memorializing the long and honorable history of coal mining in the state.

It wants people to come in, look at the exhibits, and feel a sense of pride in what the state accomplished back at a time when this country depended upon coal to provide energy.

Now, of course, times have changed a bit. The earth is getting warmer, the seas are rising, and the human population is learning that it is past time for us to learn how to live without burning fossil fuels.

Fossil fuels like coal, for example.

As technology has improved, it turns out that the burning of fossil fuels isn’t the cheapest way to provide heat and light to buildings.

Go figure.

It now turns out that the Kentucky Coal Museum is turning away from…um…coal.

CNN reports that the Coal Museum will be switching over to solar power. Why, you ask? Why would an organization that aims to glorify coal be converting to solar power?

Why, for the exact same reason that the rest of us should be converting. The communication director of the museum said that the energy conversion, in his words:

will help save at least eight to ten thousand dollars, off the energy costs on this building alone.”

Oh, the irony.

While President Trump continues to promise that coal jobs will be coming back to places like Benham, Kentucky, where the museum is located, those who run the coal museum are fully aware that its days are numbered.

So coal miners in Kentucky can take their kids and grandkids to a coal museum where they can view the exhibits in comfort and under bright lights.

Neither of which is provided by coal.

Last week, we witnessed another example of President Donald Trump effacing his predecessor’s legacy under the guise of eliminating “job-killing regulations.”









In what Trump hailed as a “new energy revolution that celebrates American production on American soil,” the United States unraveled former President Barack Obama’s 2015 Clean Power Plan which was designed to reduce carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants thirty-two percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

Those plants produce almost 40 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.

The long-term implications of climate change are mind boggling: rising sea levels due to melting polar ice caps; an increase in unpredictable and extreme weather; new or resurfacing extant diseases; food shortages that could lead to skyrocketing costs; mass migrations that could lead to military conflicts; obscene amounts of money required to construct and/or update levies and dams; an explosion in invasive plant and animal species.

On it goes.

This is not a problem “down the road.” Recently, medical organizations representing over half of American physicians launched a campaign to alert policymakers and the public to climate change’s dangers to public health.

The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health includes the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Geriatrics Society, and other professional medical groups. Dr. Mona Sarfaty, director of the Consortium, said:

“Physicians are on the front lines and see the impacts in exam rooms. What’s worse is that the harms are felt most by children, the elderly, Americans with low-income or chronic illnesses, and people in communities of color.”

The Consortium on Climate and Health’s new report delineates ways climate is already adversely affecting health, including contributing to asthma and other respiratory diseases.

The Zika virus and Lyme disease are significant health risks; however, the report states these ailments are more often found in the tropics. Their presence in more northerly climates results from an increased spread of insect-borne diseases, symptomatic of climate change.

Doctor Aparna Bole, a pediatrician at University Hospital of Cleveland, Ohio, says:

“There is great consensus in scientific, public health and medical literature that acting on climate change is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, public health opportunities of our time. As a pediatrician, I am interested in safeguarding the health of all children. In order to that, safeguarding a healthy environment is critical.”

Bole states that because children’s respiratory rates are faster than adult’s, children are more susceptible to air quality issues. She says:

“The WHO (World Health Organization) estimates that 80 percent of the health burdens of climate change will fall on children under [age] five,” Dr. Bole says.

Asthma is the most prevalent respiratory problem children face, particularly children of color and those hailing from low-income environments. In Cleveland, one in every five African American child suffers from asthma.

Doctor Bole said:

“Children living in poverty are disproportionately impacted by environmental health hazards, and climate change is no different.”

Molly Rauch is policy director for Moms Clean Air Force, an organization advocating for combating climate change and air pollution. She said:

“Asthma is an epidemic in this country. If air pollution makes asthma worse, [parents] want to know about it. And if climate change makes air pollution worse, we actually really need to know about it in order to take care of our children.”

Physicians can use the trust patients put in them to educate about climate change’s imminent health impacts. A 2014 Yale national survey found most Americans trust their primary care physicians more than the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization.

The Consortium plans on delivering its report to Congress, the Trump administration, and CEOs of Fortune 500 Companies to push for transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy.









Dr. Samantha Ahdoot, a pediatrician in Alexandria, Va., and Consortium member, said:

“We have a moral obligation to act on their [patients’] behalf. Given our current understanding today, failure to take prompt substantive action to reduce emissions would be an unprecedented injustice to every current and future child.”

There has never been a worse time to ignore the exigencies of climate change. President Trump and his cabinet may not find it convenient to acknowledge, but we still can pressure our lawmakers and down-ballot candidates in upcoming elections to put climate change mitigation paramount on their agenda.

It is no longer about hotter summers, colder winters, or more beach-front property. It’s about our health and the health of our children.

Well, everyone knows we are not fond of President Donald Trump here at Liberal America. However, we are also not fond of the Republican “Saint” and former late president Ronald Reagan. Well, here’s a comparison of just how bad they are.









1. Mental Health

Ronald Reagan eliminated tens of thousands of beds in mental hospitals all over the country. As Governor of California, he threw half of the state’s mental patients out of hospitals and onto the streets. As president, he abolished hospitals’ ability to institutionalize people with severe mental illnesses.

This may sound like a good thing, but there are some people who need the safety and structure of a hospital.

President Trump is trying to take 24 million people off of their insurance with his American Health Care Act. He will also get rid of the required coverage under the Affordable Care Act. So, things like mental health care, substance abuse, preventative care, and other things called “essential health benefits” will no longer be required to be covered. This will hurt not only the mentally ill as Reagan’s actions did, but it will hurt people spanning a range of illnesses including those with mental, emotional, and physical illnesses.

2. Elections

President Ronald Reagan was involved in a host of scandals surrounding the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). He even used taxpayer money to fix election outcomes in a scandal known as “Sewergate.” Rita Lavelle, a Reagan-appointed EPA administrator, began using EPA funds for nefarious purposes including fixing election outcomes. She diverted money into the fund for state-level Republican elections.









However, President Donald Trump, his campaign, and his politically appointed officials are under investigation for potential collusion Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who headed the investigation, this week because the investigation is beginning to gain momentum against Trump.

3. Racism

In 1986, President Ronald Reagan actually supported apartheid in South Africa. Congress passed the Anti-Apartheid Act, which would’ve put sanctions on the South African government until apartheid was lifted. President Reagan vetoed the act and opposed the sanctions. Before he was president, he also opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

President Donald Trump has twice tried to ban Middle Eastern pseople of certain countries from entering the United States. President Trump and many of his top advisors and cabinet picks have racist histories as well. He denied responsibility for all of the racist hate speech and hate crimes that his supporters committed in the days following the election.

Trump also refused to denounce the KKK and the other white supremacists who supported him during the campaign, and he opened his campaign by calling Mexicans “rapists and drug dealers” when he vowed to build a wall at the Mexican border.

On Tuesday, Ellen DeGeneres poked fun at President Trump’s gross ignorance of U.S. history. Trump’s recent comments about Andrew Jackson and The Civil War have sparked a lot of attention. Previously, Trump had also implied that the abolitionist, Frederick Douglas, was still living, and he praised both Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson who were large rivals.









Should we laugh or cry about a president who is so fundamentally ignorant when it comes to important matters? Once again, Ellen proves that the only way we can sometimes cope with having a lunatic in office is by having a good laugh.

Watch her latest spoof:

Others are having fun too at the expense of the president’s idiocy:

On a more serious note, Aidan Quigley writes:

“Trump particularly stands out from former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush, who all took an intense interest in history.”

Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, said:

“They were all people who had read about the past, they were very invested in thinking of themselves in the trajectory of other presidents.”

“That’s not who [Trump] is. … He’s not someone who reads deeply, he’s not someone who even identifies, necessarily, with the long trajectory of presidents.”

In comparison to his predecessor, Quigley also said:

“Obama’s interest in history was reflected clearly in his speeches, especially his second inaugural address. That speech was full of allusions, including to the Revolutionary War, Lincoln, the Civil War and John F. Kennedy’s 1961 inaugural. Obama also used that speech to reference Dr. Martin Luther King and the struggle for civil rights at Seneca Falls, Selma and Stonewall.”

Most of us long for the days when we had a caring, intelligent president in office. Unfortunately, Obama isn’t going to come flying in to rescue us so I guess we will have to settle for some laughs while we’re waiting for an impeachment to take place.

You couldn’t have invented the Nazis, not as literary constructs at any rate. Anyone trying to pitch the idea that a paramilitary organization that stitched skulls to their uniforms went ‘mainstream legit,’ would have been laughed out of the publishing house boardroom. Their vile antisemitism coupled with an odd infatuation with mysticism would stretch the credulity of even the most closed-minded reader.

And yet they were real. The crimes they perpetrated were real.

The Second World War was a war like no other. Few conflicts are as clear-cut as a George Lucas screenplay. There is no good, there is no evil. There are just endless shades of gray that stretch on to the horizon.









Some point to the geopolitical wisdom of George W. Bush’s war in Iraq yet fall silent when the death toll — 174,367 civilians and counting — is brought up. Others can point to Vietnam as a war that had to be fought and yet find no words that can adequately justify the sight of young Phan Thị Kim Phúc — the napalm girl — who was immortalized in 1973 in Nick Ut’s Pulitzer prize winning photograph. You know the one. The girl, running down a nameless dirt track, naked, screaming.

Covered in burns.

Few wars are worth fighting. But there is such a thing as the unavoidable conflict. The just-war fought reluctantly. Sometimes, if rarely the rhetoric isn’t hollow hackle-razing sophistry. Some wars have to be fought. There’s even a name for such conflicts, the Manichean war. It’s an old word to be sure but an apt one. It refers to an ancient religion of the same name. One that was based on the idea of moral dualism.

The idea of good vs. evil.

World War II was one such conflict.

Conventional Wisdom

There had been wars before of course. There had even been war crimes. Whilst the Geneva Conventions in their modern iteration were not implemented until 1949, attempts at laying down rules of war stretch back to the middle of the 19th century.

Moves to abolish privateering in 1856 were followed in 1864 by the ‘first’ Geneva Convention that set down rules regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 set further restrictions on what was considered to be improper behavior on the battlefield.

By the time WWI began in 1914, rules pertaining to the rights of neutral powers, the usage of certain weapons such as poisonous gas and bombs dropped from balloons were married to the more technical aspects of war. The need for a formal declaration of war prior to the commencement of hostilities and so on.

Although during WWI both sides accused one another of egregious violations of the rules, one nation was singled out as the consummate villain of the whole sorry drama. German atrocities in occupied Belgium — though exaggerated by popular propaganda cartoonists such as Louis Raemaker — were used as evidence of war guilt.

Still, the crimes committed by German troops during WWI were nothing compared to those perpetrated by the Nazi’s. Civilian casualties by direct military action cost 950,000 lives during WWI; during WWII the figure was 45,000,000.

The Last Witness

The Nuremberg trials were set up with a mind to providing a degree of closure to the millions of people whose lives had been affected by the Nazi’s murderous campaign of terror. It was not one but rather a series of trials, the most prominent being the trial of the major war criminals. It took place between November 20, 1945 and October 1, 1946.

Today, Ben Ferencz at 95 years old is the last surviving member of the prosecution team that helped bring Nazi war criminals to justice. He was charged with prosecuting 22 commanders of the Einsatzgruppen Nazi death squads at trial number 9 at Nuremberg. The SS officers in question were accused of murdering over a million men, women, and children shot down in their own towns and villages in cold blood.









Ferencz, grew up in New York City where his father found work as a janitor after having emigrated to the U.S. whilst Ben was just a baby. His early years in that tough New York neighborhood were something of a struggle. He told Lesley Stahl on last week’s 60 Minutes:

“When I was taken to school at the age of seven, I couldn’t speak English– spoke Yiddish at home. And I was very small. And so they wouldn’t let me in.”

He was a quick study though. After a short stint at college, he earned himself a scholarship to Harvard Law School, one interrupted in the very first semester by the attack on Pearl Harbor. He immediately attempted to enlist in the Army Air Corps hoping to become a pilot but they did not want him:

“No, you’re too short. Your legs won’t reach the pedals.”

“The Marines, they just looked at me and said, ‘Forget it, kid.'”

Trial Of Tears

Demoralized but not beaten, he finished his course at Harvard then enlisted as a private in the Army. He landed on the beach at Normandy. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge. His legal training, however, did not go unnoticed. He was transferred to a brand new unit charged with investigating war crimes. As concentration camps were liberated one by one, he was ordered to go in a search for evidence.

Ferencz admits that the images he saw during the Holocaust are still vivid:

“I’m still churning,” he told Stahl.

He returned to New York after the war, married his childhood sweetheart and tried to put the things he’d seen in Europe behind him.

It didn’t last.

He was called back to service by General Telford Taylor who had been put in charge of the Nuremberg trials:

“He gave me a bunch of binders, four binders. And these were daily reports from the Eastern Front– which unit entered which town, how many people they killed. It was classified, so many Jews, so many gypsies, so many others.”

With resources stretched thin, the trial almost never happened. General Taylor was adamant that he couldn’t spare the resources needed for a 9th trial:

“I started screaming. I said, look. I’ve got here mass murder, mass murder on an unparalleled scale.”

General Taylor relented, on the grounds that his perusal of the case did not interfere with Ferencz’ other duties.

Crimes Against Humanity

The accused all denied their guilt of course but Ferencz knew otherwise. Despite having never even set foot in a court before, he summarized his findings without calling a single witness. He relied instead on the defendant’s own words listed in the reports he had uncovered. Such was the case with Exhibit 111:

“In the last 10 weeks, we have liquidated around 55,000 Jews.”

Exhibit 179, from Kiev in 1941:

“The city’s Jews were ordered to present themselves… about 34,000 reported, including women and children. After they had been made to give up their clothing and valuables, all of them were killed, which took several days.”

Exhibit 84, from Einsatzgruppen D in March of 1942:

“Total number executed so far: 91,678.”

“Einsatzgruppen D was the unit of the lead defendant Otto Ohlendorf,” Ferencz explained before adding:

“He didn’t deny the killings — he had the gall to claim they were done in self-defense.”

Self Restraint

It was hard for him to listen to some of the lies that poured from the mouths of the former Nazi officers. He recalled how at times he wanted to tear a hole in the defendant right there, in the courtroom:

“There was only one time I wanted to– really. One of these– my defendants said– He gets up, and he says ‘What? The Jews were shot? I hear it here for the first time.’ Boy, I felt if I’d had a bayonet I would have jumped over the thing, and put a bayonet right through one ear, and let it come out the other. You know? You know?”

There was, at any rate, little reason to take matters into his own hands. According to the Holocaust encyclopedia:

“While 24 defendants had been indicted, only 22 were tried. Emil Hausmann had committed suicide in July 1947, and Otto Rasch was deemed too ill to stand trial. The Tribunal rendered its judgment on April 8–9, 1948, finding 20 defendants guilty on all three counts and two guilties on count three alone.”

“In all, 14 defendants were sentenced to death, two were sentenced to life terms, and five received sentences that ranged from 10 to 20 years. Only Matthias Graf was released with time served. Ultimately, only four of the 14 death sentences were carried out on June 7, 1951. The head of Einsatzkommando II, Eduard Strauch, who received a death sentence, was extradited to Belgium where he received a further death sentence. The remainder of the defendants had their sentences commuted or were paroled. All of the convicted defendants, in this case, were released from prison in 1958.”

Lessons To Be Learned

The question has to be asked though. It always has to be asked.

Why did they do it? Why did they engage in the willful slaughter of fellow human beings? What turns men into beasts?

Ferencz is more qualified than most to answer such a question and his answer might not be what you expect:

“These men would never have been murderers had it not been for the war. These were people who could quote Goethe, who loved Wagner, who were polite. He’s not a savage. He’s an intelligent, patriotic human being. He’s a patriotic human being acting in the interest of his country, in his mind.”

Such sentiment might sound surprising but Ferencz is hardly the first person to realize that patriotism — especially during times of war is often used as a way to galvanize the masses. Patriotism can shrink-wrap the brain. It can send you home in a body bag.

Because the true villain of the piece is –according to Ferencz — war itself:

“Do you think the man who dropped the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima was a savage? I will tell you something very profound, which I have learned after many years. War makes murderers out of otherwise decent people. All wars, and all decent people.”

“If it’s naive to want peace instead of war, let ’em make sure they say I’m naive. Because I want peace instead of war. If they tell me they want war instead of peace, I don’t say they’re naive, I say they’re stupid. Stupid to an incredible degree to send young people out to kill other young people they don’t even know, who never did anybody any harm, never harmed them. That is the current system.”

Young At Heart

His clarity of vision is startling though he manages to shrug it off with surprising humility:

“I’m a realist. And I see the progress. The progress has been remarkable. Look at the emancipation of woman in my lifetime. You’re sitting here as a female. Look what’s happened to the same-sex marriages. To tell somebody a man can become a woman, a woman can become a man, and a man can marry a man, they would have said, ‘You’re crazy.’ But it’s a reality today. So the world is changing. And you shouldn’t– you know– be despairing because it’s never happened before. Nothing new ever happened before.”

Such progressive views, though absolutely consistent with our best understanding of the progressive nature of history are usually the province of younger minds.

But then, Ferencz is by his own admission, still a young man:

“I’m still in there fighting. And you know what keeps me going? I know I’m right.”

Earlier this week, Donald Trump made a ridiculous statement about how President Andrew Jackson was angry he couldn’t mediate the an end to the Civil War, even though Jackson died 16 freaking years before the war began! And now we have yet another example that proves Trump knows less than nothing about history.









At his golf club in Virginia, Trump has placed a historical marker which reads:

“Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot. The casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as ‘The River of Blood.'”

You can't make this stuff up: Trump commemorated at his Virginia golf course a Civil War battle that never happened https://t.co/Wzfz7REjK8 pic.twitter.com/KelWs1Q71t — Justin Miller (@justinjm1) May 2, 2017

No such battle ever took place. As Richard Gillespie, executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association, noted:

“No. Uh-uh. No way. Nothing like that ever happened there.”

The New York Times informed the alleged president of the historical inaccuracy of the plaque, and his reaction is so typical that it will both make you nod and your head pound in excruciating pain at the same time:

“How would they know that? Were they there?”









Were you there, President Douche Canoe?!

Even better, the fake marker on the Trump golf course was signed by the Liar-in-Chief:

“It is my great honor to have preserved this important section of the Potomac River!”

One wonders, however, how sacred the spot could actually be if Trump feels it’s perfectly cool to play golf on a location where the casualties were so great there was a river of blood. Shouldn’t it be converted into a historical site and donated to the National Parks Service? Of course not, because then the lazy sack of excrement we have as our so-called leader couldn’t make any money off it.

Next thing you know, Trump will declare Trump Tower to be the site where God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses. Then he’ll take a tax write-off and charge you 20 bucks just to look in the direction of his gaudy skyscraper.

As we learned on Monday, Donald Trump knows less about history than your average two-year-old. His comments regarding former president Andrew Jackson and the Civil War were so utterly ridiculous that comedians have been adding new material by the minute.









The remarks Trump made in an interview with Sirius XM radio were bad enough, but then he made the matter worse by going on Twitter Monday evening to try and clarify what he meant. But he only made things worse:

President Andrew Jackson, who died 16 years before the Civil War started, saw it coming and was angry. Would never have let it happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2017

As a result, the Comedy Central show @Midnight created a new hashtag, #TrumpTeachesHistory, and it’s been trending with hilarious results:

Even though we’ve known for quite some time now that Donald Trump is a complete idiot who doesn’t have a clue on any variety of topics, the alleged president outdid himself in an interview with the Washington Examiner which was published Monday morning.









Trump is a great admirer of Andrew Jackson, our seventh president, and had this to say about Old Hickory:

“I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn’t have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart. He was very angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, ‘There’s no reason for this.'”

Just one itty bitty problem with that speculation on the part of the so-called head of state: Jackson died in 1845. The Civil War began in 1861.

Sounds like someone would have needed a heater and a couple gallons of smelling salts to get Jackson to join any peace talks.

Twitter wasted no time correcting the historical record and letting Trump know what a complete dolt he is:

On Saturday, the Trump administration will reach the historical marker of 100 days in office. And this so-called president hasn’t accomplished a single thing. He has failed at his travel ban, the repeal and replacement of Obamcare, his oft-promised wall on the Southern border, tax reform, etc. The number of legislative accomplishments he has in his first three months is easy to calculate. You start and stop at the number zero.









Some conservative historians were recently asked to evaluate and comment on Trump’s 100 days, and what most of them had to say will not exactly make the alleged head of state the least bit happy:

Daniel Pipes–Professor of public policy at Pepperdine University and the president of the Middle East Forum

“Donald Trump as president hardly differs from Trump as candidate: a blowhard who insouciantly breaks with customs and laws, delighting his fans and infuriating the rest of the world, sometimes getting it right but more often proving ineffectually amateurish. The great question is whether he will learn from his many mistakes and turn into a more conventional, respectable, and intelligent president – or whether he will continue in the same mold through the whole four-year period. I am pessimistic. However, if he is egregious enough and Republican members of Congress sick enough of him, we could well have a President Pence.”









Robert Merry–Editor of The American Conservative

“Whether Russia, Syria, China’s trade posture, the World Bank, NATO, or draining the swamp, Trump has abandoned not just a promise or two, but the entire rationale of his campaign. This is the greatest open display of political cynicism in American history.”

Andrew Bacevich

“Trump is not a conservative. Nothing that he represents, says, or has done deserves the support of principled conservatives.

“Donald Trump’s first 100 days have seen the appointment and termination of decorated general Michael Flynn from the Defense Intelligence Agency, the eclipse of former Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon, a steady decline in the relationship with Russia, the bombing of Syria, a failed attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, and two failed attempts to impose a ban on certain groups of immigrants. This wasn’t exactly what Trump promised.”

I’m not a historian, but based on what I’ve seen so far, if Trump’s first 100 days were a term paper turned in as part of a class I teach, he’d get a D at best. And that’s if I was feeling particularly charitable that day.

"Women have been a driving force throughout our history. Here are just a few of the amazing women that changed the world we live in today:

1. This Old Lady

This Holocaust survivor beat up a Neo-Nazi with her handbag in 1985.

2. Kathrine Switzer

When Kathrine Switzer entered the #BostonMarathon in 1967, a race official tried to drag her off the course https://t.co/SLs3A5QE4v pic.twitter.com/JRhBPqW7tY





— Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) April 19, 2017

This is Kathrine Switzer. Remembered for sneaking into the Boston Marathon in 1967 when it was for men only. The race organizers tried to tackle her and drag her off the course when they found out, but other runners protected her so she could finish. She has since run in 39 marathons around the world, and celebrated 50 years since her iconic moment by running the Boston Marathon again in 2017.

3. Margaret Heafield Hamilton

This woman helped code the software in the Apollo 11 mission. President Barack Obama awarded her the Medal of Freedom in 2016. The citation for her medal read:

“Hamilton contributed to concepts of asynchronous software, priority scheduling and priority displays, and human-in-the-loop decision capability, which set the foundation for modern, ultra-reliable software design and engineering,”

4. Maud Stevens Wagner









She was the first known female tattoo artist in the United States.

5. Annette Kellerman

She was arrested for indecency in 1907. She won the right to wear a fitted one-piece bathing suit. Enjoy your bikinis thanks to this awesome chick!

6. Hattie Larlham

Hattie Larlham pioneered care for developmentally disabled children. From her organization’s website:

“Thanks to one woman’s courage, tenacity and compassion, Hattie Larlham has become a proven leader in the care and treatment of children and adults with severe development disabilities. That woman, our founder, Hattie Lena Gadd Larlham, had a dream that all people with developmental disabilities would be able to receive the highest quality of care possible. Today, Hattie Larlham continues that dream by providing that level of care to more than 1,800 children and adults with developmental disabilities throughout Ohio.”

“Larlham passed away February 28, 1996. In accordance with her final wishes, she is buried at the Hattie Larlham Center for Children with Disabilities where a memorial walk commemorates her dedication.”

7. Sybil Ludington

This badass Colonial woman rode twice as far as Paul Revere to alert the Colonial forces that the British were coming. Yet, they don’t talk about her in schools.

Yes, President Trump has done it again. He congratulated someone for winning the Purple Heart. This is the medal that no one wants!

Pres. Trump awards Purple Heart to Army Sgt. Alvaro Barrientos, who was recently wounded in Afghanistan https://t.co/Xucpktr8ji pic.twitter.com/RhZaQbugwY — ABC News (@ABC) April 22, 2017

This guy lost a leg! A leg!









That is not something you congratulate someone for, Trump!

During the campaign, he once joked that he “always wanted” a Purple Heart. At a rally, Trump said:

“You know something very nice just happened to me. A man came up to me and he handed me his Purple Heart.”

“He said, ‘that’s my real Purple Heart I have such confidence in you.’ And I said, ‘Man that’s like big stuff. I’ve always wanted to get the real Purple Heart.’ This was much easier.”

Sean Barney, who was shot in the neck in Fallujah in 2006, wrote this about it on Facebook:

“As someone who fought for our country in Iraq, was injured, and was awarded a Purple Heart, I can tell you, no one should ever “want” to get a Purple Heart.”









Here are some of the internet’s reactions to Trump’s congratulating a man for getting a Purple Heart:

Oh…dear.

@barbarastarrcnn So inappropriate. You don't congratulate a soldier for being wounded. You thank them for their service, dedication and sacrifice. — SchoolHouseRockAlum (@HouseOfMichele) April 22, 2017

The Purple Heart is given to soldiers who are wounded or killed in battle. The medal goes back to 1782 when George Washington gave his soldiers “Badges of Merit” and “Badges of Distinction.”

Washington wrote this on the medals:

“The General ever desirous to cherish a virtuous ambition in his soldiers, as well as to foster and encourage every species of Military Merit, directs that whenever any singularly meritorious action is performed, the author of it shall be permitted to wear on his facings over the left breast, the figure of a heart in purple cloth or silk, edged with narrow lace or binding. Not only instances of unusual gallantry, but also of extraordinary fidelity and essential service in any way shall meet with a due reward.”

Seriously, Trump, read up on the awards you are giving. You are the Commander in Chief!

Former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev has given an ominous warning about what he sees as threatening signs of conflict emerging between the West and Russia. Speaking to German newspaper Bild the Nobel Peace prize winner said:

“All the indications of a Cold War are there.”









He added:

“The language of politicians and the top-level military personnel is becoming increasingly militant. Military doctrines are formulated increasingly harshly. The media picks up on all of this and adds fuel to the fire. The relationship between the big powers continues to worsen.”

Gorbachev speaks of these tensions – not in a future tense, but a present one:

“It is not merely imminent. In some places, it is already in full swing. Troops are being moved into Europe, including heavy equipment such as tanks and armored cars. It was not so long ago that NATO troops and Russian troops were stationed quite far away from each other. They now stand nose-to-nose.”









In the interview he speaks of the importance of repairing the Russian/German relationship. He also advises that the West:

“must take Russia seriously as a nation that deserves respect,”

adding that he wants the West to realize that:

“Russia is on the path to democracy. It’s half way between. There are approximately 30 emerging nations that are in transition and we are one of them.”

Worryingly Gorbachev warns against sanctions against Russia, as he says it turns the Russian people against the West and of this situation he says “anything could happen.”

Thanks to decades of suspicion and an escalating arms race between the then USSR and US, the 1980s were also a time of fear. At one stage both countries had so many nuclear weapons, the world could have been blown up many times over. Thank goodness for the relationship between Reagan and Gorbachev that eventually saw the disarming and diffusion of tensions.

Warnings against war need to be heard right now. As Sting wrote in the 1980s in his famous Cold War inspired song The Russians:

“There’s no such thing as a winnable war, it’s a lie we don’t believe anymore.”

Nuclear war means game over. With tensions rising in Syria, North Korea and Russia, this is a warning we must hear.

Russian media knows this and Russian news anchor Dmitry Kiselyov, who previously welcomed a Trump presidency has now said:

“The world is a hair’s breadth from nuclear war.

War can break out as a result of confrontation between two personalities; Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un. Both are dangerous, but who is more dangerous? Trump is.”

Again we are looking at history repeating itself. This is not a game, Trump now has war brewing on many fronts.

Right now we have to focus on diplomacy, diffusion, and everything we can do to avoid war.

Watch this report after Gorbachev wrote an opinion piece for Time magazine:

Sting wrote the song Russians in the midst of this war, unfortunately we see history repeating itself:

Uh-oh! Things are getting even more awkward for the Obama administration. While the liberal media spouts nonsense about Trump’s ties to Russia, they ignore a huge story- Obama’s appointees may have been unlawfully spying on the Trump team before and after the election.

So much for the “scandal-free presidency”!

According to Circa, the House Intelligence Committee has named top Obama aide Samantha Power in a subpoena during its investigation into unlawful spying on Americans. The Committee also issued subpoenas naming two other top Obama associates in the same investigation: former National Security Adviser Susan Rice and former CIA Director John Brennan.

Susan Rice, a known liar who famously blamed the attacks on Americans in Benghazi on a Youtube video, initially denied that she had unmasked American names in intelligence briefings. She later came clean, but stated she had a good reason to unmask the names and did not do it “for political purposes.”

Yeah right! Why should we believe her now?

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes claimed weeks ago that he saw evidence NSA data had been improperly used to spy on the Trump transition team. These new subpoena orders seem to suggest he was right.

The liberal media won’t report this, so it’s up to us to spread the word and share this Obama scandal one million times!

Michael Bloomberg may be a gun-hating, soda-regulating liberal, but it seems like the ultra-billionaire may have a bit of sense to him left. Today he did an interview with the NY Times where he SHOCKED the reporter when Bloomberg told him his prediction for the 2020 elections.

Bloomberg said there is a 55% chance Trump WILL be re-elected in 2020.

Michael Bloomberg told the reporter that he believes that infighting in the Democrats will doom the party in upcoming elections, an issue he does NOT see them resolving in time.

“They’ll step on each other and re-elect Donald Trump. There is a 55 percent chance he gets re-elected.”

Of course, Bloomberg’s interview went beyond Trump. Apparently, he is just as sick of Hillary Clinton as the rest of us.

He said the REAL reason Clinton failed and will always fail is that her strategy is essentially ‘Vote for me because I’m a woman and the other guy’s bad.’

Well, Bloomberg may be a failed politician, but he still is a pretty smart guy. He basically runs the New York Stock Exchange. So, if he says Trump is a shoo-in for the next election, that’s a reason to celebrate.

They always say the best way to make a prediction come true is to spread it, so let’s share this everywhere and make sure Trump really does win a second term."

It appears that now states are revolting against President Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement.

3 states have already joined together now in opposition of President Trump’s decision to save the country trillions of dollars.

Those states include New York, Washington, and of course California and are calling themselves the United States Climate Alliance.

BREAKING: CA, NY & WA governors reject Pres. Trump’s decision; will convene alliance of US states that want to uphold climate accord – NBC — Breaking911 (@Breaking911) June 2, 2017

Washington state governor Jay Inslee had a lot to say about his distaste of saving the country that wasn’t asked by Obama in the first place if they wanted to join the Paris Climate Agreement.

Inslee claims in his statement “the inaction in D.C. is met by an equal force of action from the states.”

Is he referring to the last 8 years and our economy because President Trump is taking action in taking down the deficit that Obama created while sitting idly by and watching the world turn.

The American people were never asked if they wanted to join the Paris agreement and if these states want to bankrupt themselves, they won’t receive any funding from the White House when they run out.

Trump promised the American people that he would pull out of the agreement and he followed through on yet another promise.

President Trump had strong words during his announcement to pull out of the climate agreement where he said that he was elected to protect the people of Pittsburgh no Paris and that is exactly what he chose to do.

Rather than bankrupt our economy that was soaring to record highs as he made the announcement, he chose to put the welfare of the American people first rather than risk destroying the economy again with more debt.

It will take our country years to pay off the debt of Obama and that is what President Trump has put first above all else."

It will take our country years to pay off the debt of Obama and that is what President Trump has put first above all else."

The White House audience broke out in applause after President Trump announced that he was pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord. The cost of the climate deal was $3 trillion.

Nigel Farage is a conservative member of the British Parliament and was one of the frontrunners of the Brexit movement. He also was a fan of President Trump’s campaign and what he stood for, coming over to help him with his campaign.

HE MUST BE A RUSSIAN SPY THEN!

The liberal paper The Guardian of course thinks that after they reported that he is now a “Person of Interest” in the FBI’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Pretty soon they are going to claim that everyone that ever went to a Trump rally is a Russian spy.

But Nigel Farage wasn’t phased one bit by these false accusations ONE BIT!

His response not only shows how ridiculous these accusations are but also will make the Democrats heads blow!

He first followed Trump’s lead and called this exactly what it is, FAKE NEWS.

“This is fake news…. I have never been to Russia. I never had a Russian bank account. I have no Russian political connections whatsoever. This is completely hysterical nonsense.”

Hysterical nonsense is exactly right.

Farage is exactly right that the only source that the Guardian had was that they called the FBI and they neither confirmed or denied that he was a part of the investigation.

The fact that that story was even allowed to run shows that the Guardian belongs right next to the Washington Post, New York Times, and most of all CNN.

If simply being connected to Trump means that you are being investigated in this investigation then it is going to take a long time and maybe they will even get around to investigating Hillary again.

Seeing as her and Trump have met on multiple occasions, there could a connection to Russia there.

Share this everywhere to show that according to the Democrats being conservative means you’re a Russian agent.

The left has made a habit out of criticizing any Republican politician – from Mitt Romney to Donald Trump— just for being wealthy from their successful business ventures. Democrats complain about hard-earned Republican wealth despite people like Hillary and Bill Clinton raking in tens of millions of dollars from speaking fees and book deals just to talk about how great they are.

Well, here’s another story the liberal media won’t be reporting on: Barack Obama recently bought his second home, an 8,200 square-foot, 8 bedroom, 9 bath, mansion in an exclusive neighborhood in D.C., for a whopping $8.1 MILLION.

This is the second-most expensive home purchased in D.C., even more expensive than the homes purchased by Ivanka Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the same neighborhood. Ivanka Trump and Rex Tillerson have both been derided on the left for having money, but will anyone be calling out Barack and Michelle Obama? I don’t think so.

Following in the footsteps of Bill and Hillary, the Obamas are already amassing a personal fortune by signing book deals and collecting speaker fees- not by building a business or getting a real job, which might add actual value to the economy and the country. I wish I could say I was surprised!

The Obama’s mansion purchase is just one more example of how liberals will never criticize a wealthy Democrat, even after denouncing wealthy Republicans.

Share this one million times to expose the left’s hypocrisy!

President Donald Trump just kept one of his BIGGEST campaign promises of all. After meeting with world leaders, the US President has made his FINAL decision on the Paris Climate Accords.

Trump has EXITED the Paris Climate Change Accords completely.

However, this does not mean that America is 100% done with the Climate Change negotiations. Actually, Donald Trump is willing to rejoin IF they change the agreement to benefit, not hurt, US businesses.

According to the President, staying in the accord would see the United States lose 35% of Iron and Steelwork to foreign countries and a whopping 80% of coal jobs.

While the US immediately suffers, China doesn’t have to even BEGIN to clean up for 13 years. That’s not fair. Plus, it forces our country to PAY a huge sum of money to the United Nations every year for them to both pockets and hand out to other countries.

So, while I’m sure all the leftists are gonna try and claim the world is “doomed” (despite the Wall Street Journal saying the US participation will do almost NOTHING for the environment), it’s all a big load. Donald Trump is simply keeping America First, and Thank God for that.

So let’s set the story straight. Trump loves the environment and is even willing to renegotiate a HORRIBLE deal as long as America doesn’t get the wrong end of the stick. Now he needs y’all to share this with your friends and family and show them what REALLY happened today.

You know, it’s sad that this is what we have to do just to have a fair shot. Still, we will do whatever it takes."

Two US warships have just arrived off the coast of North Korea and are carrying out drills in the Sea of Japan. The USS Carl Vinson and the USS Ronald Reagan are part of the “Armada” that Trump said was on its way to the peninsula. The video that is referenced in the picture above is at the bottom of the article. You should watch it.

In April, Trump said that the US was sending an “armada” to the Peninsula. It turned out that the aircraft carrier was thousands of miles away at the time, says Daily Mail.

This also comes right after Trump sent North Korea another message…

According to the Huffington Post, the US military has now successfully tested its first ever missile defense test to simulate a ballistic missile being sent from North Korea.

A missile was fired from the Kwajelein Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands, toward the waters south of Alaska. Another missile was flown from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to intercept it.

The test was successful.

Share this to pray for our troops and our sailors in the region. The are going to need it in the days to come. Thanks, patriots.

Thank goodness that we have Trump right now to face off against Kim Jong Un and actually deal with him."

On Tuesday, Comedienne Kathy Griffin posted a photo and video of her holding a severed Donald Trump head. Griffin did it with photographer Tyler Shields. It was disgusting. Look who just stepped up to defend the Trump family. It’s…

Kathy Griffin got torn apart after Conservatives bombarded CNN and pushed for them to fire Kathy Griffin. They did. CNN terminated their contract with Kathy Griffin on Wednesday.

*** On Wednesday, Rosanne Barr weighed in on Griffin’s stunt on Wednesday.

11-year-old Barron Trump was traumatized after seeing the image of Kathy Griffin holding his father’s severed head on TV. He thought that something had happened to his father… THESE LIBERALS ARE HORRIBLE! They are terrorizing little kids like thugs.

Sooooooo look what Kathy Griffin said.

two of my grandsons r Barron Trump's age. I would slap the fuck out of any bitch or any prick who upset them-trust me on that. — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 31, 2017

OHhhhhhhhhh! You got to love Roseanne Bar. She tells it like it is. It seems Kathy Griffin thought that what she did would be a good idea – which is telling about the mindset of liberals right now.

Share this everywhere if you think it is disgusting that Liberals have reached this point.

The liberal left are terrorizing little kids – like ISIS."

In an interview on Tuesday, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told CNN’s Chris Cuomo something that is going to piss off every liberal in this country and make every Trump voter want to cheer. Get ready to see this, y’all.

You heard that right? James Clapper just said that there is NO direct evidence of political collusion between Trump and the Russians. He said the same thing on NBC.

Clapper confirmed this again “no direct evidence of political collusion,” Cuomo demanded a clarification, “because people use you and those words as an example of this premise, which is there’s nothing there.”

You can watch the full interview below.

CLAPPER: “Well, I don’t — I wouldn’t go so far as to say that. But I also have to say that, with specific respect to the issue of collusion, as I’ve said before — I’ve testified to this effect — I saw no direct evidence of political collusion between the campaign and — the Trump campaign and the Russians.”

CUOMO: “Now clarify that point.”

CLAPPER: “That’s not to say — that’s not to say there wasn’t any, but I just didn’t see evidence of it before I left.”

The media is not covering this. The former CIA director now said on TV multiple times that there is no proof of Russian collusion.

Share this to help clear our President of all the bull**** charges that the left is slinging at him.

It doesn’t get any clearer than this admission.

In an interview on Tuesday, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told CNN’s Chris Cuomo something that is going to piss off every liberal in this country and make every Trump voter want to cheer. Get ready to see this, y’all.

You heard that right? James Clapper just said that there is NO direct evidence of political collusion between Trump and the Russians. He said the same thing on NBC.

Clapper confirmed this again “no direct evidence of political collusion,” Cuomo demanded a clarification, “because people use you and those words as an example of this premise, which is there’s nothing there.”

You can watch the full interview below.

CLAPPER: “Well, I don’t — I wouldn’t go so far as to say that. But I also have to say that, with specific respect to the issue of collusion, as I’ve said before — I’ve testified to this effect — I saw no direct evidence of political collusion between the campaign and — the Trump campaign and the Russians.”

CUOMO: “Now clarify that point.”

CLAPPER: “That’s not to say — that’s not to say there wasn’t any, but I just didn’t see evidence of it before I left.”

The media is not covering this. The former CIA director now said on TV multiple times that there is no proof of Russian collusion.

Share this to help clear our President of all the bull**** charges that the left is slinging at him.

It doesn’t get any clearer than this admission.

We all know that the U.S. has been taken advantage of by many other countries, including Germany and the European Union. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been critical of President Trump since the beginning of his presidency, released yet another hostile statement directed towards the President, saying “The times we could completely rely on others are, to an extent, over.”

She was implying that President Trump is unpredictable, and that America cannot be trusted as an ally.

Well, luckily we now have a President in charge that isn’t afraid to stick up for American interests, and that won’t be bullied by Europe. Trump hit back at Merkel with an absolutely epic tweet:

Talk about hard truths! Trump just put Germany on notice- the American people will no longer be paying for Germany’s military defense, and we are going to start creating FAIR TRADE between our nations. Trump will make sure our friendships in Europe are strong, but he just told EVERYONE that the era of America giving money and resources to every other country, with no thanks in return, is OVER.

Thank GOD we finally have a president ready to put AMERICA FIRST!!

The Mayor of Portland, Oregon just showed his true colors today when he announced his intention to STEAL the 1st Amendment from Trump supporters.

I wish I was kidding, but I’m not in the slightest. Mayor Ted Wheeler is now actively calling for the cancellation of the “Trump free speech rally” and ANY similar rallies from this point on.

According to the SJW mayor, pro-Trump and pro-Conservative events “peddle a message of hatred.”

What’s even sicker is that the mayor is using the HORRIBLE tragedy that took place in his city to push his agenda. He referenced the White Supremacist who murdered the young man and Navy Veteran on a train over the weekend.

Also, it’s nuts to say that President Trump advocates for people like this when he clearly does not. If the Mayor took 5 seconds to read this Tweet posted by the President today he could see for himself where Donald Trump and his supporters stand.

The violent attacks in Portland on Friday are unacceptable. The victims were standing up to hate and intolerance. Our prayers are w/ them. — President Trump (@POTUS) May 29, 2017

See? Oh and as far as the claim that those are “Trump’s people”, here is the murder being REJECTED by Trump supporters at the rally he was kicked out of.

It’s like I said before, Mayor Wheeler could have seen this for himself with a simple internet search. However, his bigotry towards the right clouded his judgment and now he is rejecting them and the US Constitution.

You could see this and say “Well, it’s not in my state so who cares?” However, it’s important to share this out and tell them we will NOT sit by and watch this happen. Otherwise, how long until Liberals around the country make it ILLEGAL to even think differently?"

President Donald Trump just kept one of his BIGGEST campaign promises of all. After meeting with world leaders, the US President has made his FINAL decision on the Paris Climate Accords.

Trump has EXITED the Paris Climate Change Accords completely.

However, this does not mean that America is 100% done with the Climate Change negotiations. Actually, Donald Trump is willing to rejoin IF they change the agreement to benefit, not hurt, US businesses.

According to the President, staying in the accord would see the United States lose 35% of Iron and Steelwork to foreign countries and a whopping 80% of coal jobs.

While the US immediately suffers, China doesn’t have to even BEGIN to clean up for 13 years. That’s not fair. Plus, it forces our country to PAY a huge sum of money to the United Nations every year for them to both pockets and hand out to other countries.

So, while I’m sure all the leftists are gonna try and claim the world is “doomed” (despite the Wall Street Journal saying the US participation will do almost NOTHING for the environment), it’s all a big load. Donald Trump is simply keeping America First, and Thank God for that.

So let’s set the story straight. Trump loves the environment and is even willing to renegotiate a HORRIBLE deal as long as America doesn’t get the wrong end of the stick. Now he needs y’all to share this with your friends and family and show them what REALLY happened today.

You know, it’s sad that this is what we have to do just to have a fair shot. Still, we will do whatever it takes."

Trump just won big again! It is now being confirmed that President Donald Trump has identified at least three White House staff members as leakers. Thank God.

Well, don’t you worry. It has now become widely known that the SECOND the President lands…

…Trump is gonna FIRE all 3 and have the authorities handle them.

The story was first reported by Trey Yingst of OANN who Tweeted,

SCOOP: Three White House staffers have been identified for leaking classified info. POTUS will fire 'multiple people' when he returns to DC. — Trey Yingst (@TreyYingst) May 22, 2017

Since then, other major outlets have received the same scoop, including CBS, who added that President Trump has already reported the leakers to authorities.

Of course, these traitors to our country deserve a lot more than a simple firing. They put us a risk, spread classified intelligence, and almost cost us our Relationship with England this week after one of them leaked top-secret intelligence to the NY Times less than an HOUR after receiving it.

It is thought that the leakers are all Obama-holdovers who want to sabotage Trump, however, we will know the truth soon enough. Maybe now Trump can FINALLY get some work done without being harassed. That would be a real miracle."

Vice President Mike Pence is the most loving, considerate man and husband ever, ya’ll!

This morning, he was giving a speech at the Naval Academy, in front of its graduates. Watch what he does, about four minutes into his speech though:

He introduces his wife as “my commanding officer!” Isn’t that just the sweetest thing you’ve ever heard?

Karen Pence is the “Second Lady” of the United States, and a Marine Corp. Mom! She was with our VP today, by his side.

What a real Patriot Mike Pence is, and what a patriotic family he has!

Let’s get this shared out everywhere, ya’ll. With all the negativity the media is trying to spread about this administration, we need to get this out. SHARE a million times, and comment “We love the Pence’s!”

*** Spread this everywhere if you are proud of our Vice President!"

The leakers have gone too far. Last week one almost cost us our relationship with the UK just to get a scoop on some photos. Well guess what… Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly is right PI$$ED.

Kelly went on Meet the Press on Sunday and, in no uncertain words, let the leakers know how HE feels about them.

Secretary Kelly Said The Leaks Were Basically TREASON!

The Secretary of Homeland Security told the Chuck Todd:

“I believe when you leak the kind of information that seems to be routinely leaked – high, high level of classification… I think it’s darn close to treason.”

Hell, I’d say the words “darn close” are generous. What they did served NO purpose other than to hurt America. The leakers have shown their true colors and stepped far over the line.

It’s not just this one leak, either. It’s the whole lot of them. Every single leak has been to undermine our government. If the Russians really WERE trying to destroy the country, that would be the FIRST place I’d look.

Regardless of who is behind it, be it Obama, Putin, George Soros, or just a lonely and angry liberal, it needs to stop. These leakers are not friends of the country and the need to be found, interrogated, and punished according to the law.

Share this only if you agree it’s time to lay the hammer down on these leaks."

Uh-oh! Things are getting even more awkward for the Obama administration. While the liberal media spouts nonsense about Trump’s ties to Russia, they ignore a huge story- Obama’s appointees may have been unlawfully spying on the Trump team before and after the election.

So much for the “scandal-free presidency”!

According to Circa, the House Intelligence Committee has named top Obama aide Samantha Power in a subpoena during its investigation into unlawful spying on Americans. The Committee also issued subpoenas naming two other top Obama associates in the same investigation: former National Security Adviser Susan Rice and former CIA Director John Brennan.

Susan Rice, a known liar who famously blamed the attacks on Americans in Benghazi on a Youtube video, initially denied that she had unmasked American names in intelligence briefings. She later came clean, but stated she had a good reason to unmask the names and did not do it “for political purposes.”

Yeah right! Why should we believe her now?

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes claimed weeks ago that he saw evidence NSA data had been improperly used to spy on the Trump transition team. These new subpoena orders seem to suggest he was right.

The liberal media won’t report this, so it’s up to us to spread the word and share this Obama scandal one million times!

It appears that now states are revolting against President Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement.

3 states have already joined together now in opposition of President Trump’s decision to save the country trillions of dollars.

Those states include New York, Washington, and of course California and are calling themselves the United States Climate Alliance.

BREAKING: CA, NY & WA governors reject Pres. Trump’s decision; will convene alliance of US states that want to uphold climate accord – NBC — Breaking911 (@Breaking911) June 2, 2017

Washington state governor Jay Inslee had a lot to say about his distaste of saving the country that wasn’t asked by Obama in the first place if they wanted to join the Paris Climate Agreement.

Inslee claims in his statement “the inaction in D.C. is met by an equal force of action from the states.”

Is he referring to the last 8 years and our economy because President Trump is taking action in taking down the deficit that Obama created while sitting idly by and watching the world turn.

The American people were never asked if they wanted to join the Paris agreement and if these states want to bankrupt themselves, they won’t receive any funding from the White House when they run out.

Trump promised the American people that he would pull out of the agreement and he followed through on yet another promise.

President Trump had strong words during his announcement to pull out of the climate agreement where he said that he was elected to protect the people of Pittsburgh no Paris and that is exactly what he chose to do.

Rather than bankrupt our economy that was soaring to record highs as he made the announcement, he chose to put the welfare of the American people first rather than risk destroying the economy again with more debt.

It will take our country years to pay off the debt of Obama and that is what President Trump has put first above all else."

The White House audience broke out in applause after President Trump announced that he was pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord. The cost of the climate deal was $3 trillion. Trump decided to stand with the American worker against the globalists elites. Here is how the new leader of France has responded. See Trump’s secret weapon below.

So Trump pulled out his secret weapon to fight the globalists. He has sided with the American people.

Obama agrees with this foreign leader. He released the following statement below. Barack Obama isn’t happy seeing his legacy unravel as Trump totally takes it apart.

Obama used his power as president to join the Paris Accord without a vote. Trump can use the same power to quit it.

Barack Hussein Obama says that people will fight back against Trump. No, they won’t. The people of the United States are glad that we have President that we always wanted. Look what he said below. It was pretty damn clear what he said.

Trump’s secret weapon is that he is fighting for the American people and it is showing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high.

Or as Trump put it today ver simply…

Trump’s secret weapon is that

*** Share this if you are glad that Trump pulled out us out of the globalist Paris Accords!!

He needs the support. The liberal media is in meltdown."

Nigel Farage is a conservative member of the British Parliament and was one of the frontrunners of the Brexit movement. He also was a fan of President Trump’s campaign and what he stood for, coming over to help him with his campaign.

HE MUST BE A RUSSIAN SPY THEN!

The liberal paper The Guardian of course thinks that after they reported that he is now a “Person of Interest” in the FBI’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Pretty soon they are going to claim that everyone that ever went to a Trump rally is a Russian spy.

But Nigel Farage wasn’t phased one bit by these false accusations ONE BIT!

His response not only shows how ridiculous these accusations are but also will make the Democrats heads blow!

He first followed Trump’s lead and called this exactly what it is, FAKE NEWS.

“This is fake news…. I have never been to Russia. I never had a Russian bank account. I have no Russian political connections whatsoever. This is completely hysterical nonsense.”

Hysterical nonsense is exactly right.

Farage is exactly right that the only source that the Guardian had was that they called the FBI and they neither confirmed or denied that he was a part of the investigation.

The fact that that story was even allowed to run shows that the Guardian belongs right next to the Washington Post, New York Times, and most of all CNN.

If simply being connected to Trump means that you are being investigated in this investigation then it is going to take a long time and maybe they will even get around to investigating Hillary again.

Seeing as her and Trump have met on multiple occasions, there could a connection to Russia there.

Share this everywhere to show that according to the Democrats being conservative means you’re a Russian agent.

The left has made a habit out of criticizing any Republican politician – from Mitt Romney to Donald Trump— just for being wealthy from their successful business ventures. Democrats complain about hard-earned Republican wealth despite people like Hillary and Bill Clinton raking in tens of millions of dollars from speaking fees and book deals just to talk about how great they are.

Well, here’s another story the liberal media won’t be reporting on: Barack Obama recently bought his second home, an 8,200 square-foot, 8 bedroom, 9 bath, mansion in an exclusive neighborhood in D.C., for a whopping $8.1 MILLION.

This is the second-most expensive home purchased in D.C., even more expensive than the homes purchased by Ivanka Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the same neighborhood. Ivanka Trump and Rex Tillerson have both been derided on the left for having money, but will anyone be calling out Barack and Michelle Obama? I don’t think so.

Following in the footsteps of Bill and Hillary, the Obamas are already amassing a personal fortune by signing book deals and collecting speaker fees- not by building a business or getting a real job, which might add actual value to the economy and the country. I wish I could say I was surprised!

The Obama’s mansion purchase is just one more example of how liberals will never criticize a wealthy Democrat, even after denouncing wealthy Republicans.

Share this one million times to expose the left’s hypocrisy!

On Tuesday, Comedienne Kathy Griffin posted a photo and video of her holding a severed Donald Trump head. Griffin did it with photographer Tyler Shields. It was disgusting. Look who just stepped up to defend the Trump family. It’s…

Kathy Griffin got torn apart after Conservatives bombarded CNN and pushed for them to fire Kathy Griffin. They did. CNN terminated their contract with Kathy Griffin on Wednesday.

*** On Wednesday, Rosanne Barr weighed in on Griffin’s stunt on Wednesday.

11-year-old Barron Trump was traumatized after seeing the image of Kathy Griffin holding his father’s severed head on TV. He thought that something had happened to his father… THESE LIBERALS ARE HORRIBLE! They are terrorizing little kids like thugs.

Sooooooo look what Kathy Griffin said.

two of my grandsons r Barron Trump's age. I would slap the fuck out of any bitch or any prick who upset them-trust me on that. — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 31, 2017

OHhhhhhhhhh! You got to love Roseanne Bar. She tells it like it is. It seems Kathy Griffin thought that what she did would be a good idea – which is telling about the mindset of liberals right now.

Yesterday all-time Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings made a HORRIBLE joke about Barron Trump, the President’s son.

After seeing Kathy Griffin‘s video of a beheaded Donald Trump, Barron was shocked and cried, believing his father had died. Jennings thought he would make fun of the poor 11-year-old to prove how tough he is.

Jennings Tweeted:

“Barron Trump saw a very long necktie on a heap of expired deli meat in a dumpster. He thought it was his dad & his little heart is breaking.”

Donald Jr saw this and immediately took action to stand up for his little brother. He fired back,

“It takes a real man to pick on an 11-year-old. Yet another low from the left, but they will rationalize this away with their usual excuses.”

Oh heck yeah! Get ’em Don Jr. But the punishment did not end there, trust me.

The whole lot of Trump supporters picked up on Donald Jr’s Tweet and organized an effort to force publisher Simon and Schuster to DROP Jenning’s children’s book series as punishment for how he treats kids.

Hopefully, they will succeed and teach these carefree radical leftists that there ARE consequences to their actions. It seems that they have forgotten this lesson.

So help spread the fight by sharing this with all your friends and family. After you do that, feel free to visit the Simon and Schuster social media and tell them how YOU feel about Ken Jennings."

That’s all she wrote for Kathy Griffin! One short day after releasing a photograph displaying the decapitated head of our Commander-In-Chief, CNN has announced they have justifiable FIRED the desperate comedian.

“We found what she did disgusting and offensive,” read a statement sent to USA TODAY by CNN spokesman Shimrit Sheetrit. “We are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down.”

Griffin took to Twitter Tuesday night in an effort to quickly cover her tracks.

“I crossed the line,” she said. “I went way too far. The image is too disturbing, I understand how it offends people. It wasn’t funny. I get it. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career, I will continue to. I ask for your forgiveness.”

But the damage was already done in the worst way possible. The image did more than affect American citizens, it was a personal attack on President Trump’s entire family.

“Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11-year-old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!” Tweeted President Trump, with similar sentiments echoed by the First Lady. “As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,” the first lady said in a statement issued by her press secretary, Stephanie Grisham.

The disgraced comedian would not find solace in her colleagues either, even those who have worked alongside her for years. Anderson Cooper, longtime co-host of CNN’s New Year’s Eve program alongside Griffin, offered zero sympathy for his partner’s actions.

“For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in,” he tweeted Tuesday night. “It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.”

There is no doubt what Griffin did is deplorable and she has earned each and every consequence that comes her way, but this should only be the beginning. Celebrities and high-ranking officials should ALWAYS be held accountable for their actions against the White House and its Family. What kind of precedent does this set for our children, for our representatives, for our country as a whole? Where has America’s respect gone?

I say we use this opportunity to set the standard from this day forward. There is nothing funny about abusing our constitutional rights. Either we stand up as one nation with one voice, or this complete disregard for our beautiful country and its leaders will be nothing but a tasteless joke. We have a job to do, and taking down people like Griffin is only the beginning.

This was just “Sick!” We all saw the sick thing that D-list comedian Kathy Griffin did yesterday. She posted a sick video of herself posing with a video of a severed head on social media. She was forced to apologize immediately. She did in this very lame apology video which you can watch below. Can you spot her rolling her eyes in it?

Kathy Griffin tweeted out: “I am sorry. I went too far. I was wrong.” Does she mean it, though?



“My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!’ Trump tweeted. Can you believe that Trump’s son watched that?

Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2017

Kathy Griffin is losing a lot of work because that shameless picture that she posted. She is starting to lose sponsorships as we speak. Why is it that leftists think they can do this crap?

This shouldn’t stop here. This is disgusting that Trump’s young son had to see this sick crap. CNN is currently “evaluating” keeping her right now to cover their New Year’s Eve coverage but have made no decisions at this point, says Daily Mail.

Dear @CNN, I must have missed your statement banning your commentator #KathyGriffin from future shows. Please resend. Thx — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) May 31, 2017

Here is what CNN currently says: “We found what she did disgusting and offensive. We are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down. We are evaluating New Year’s Eve and have made no decisions at this point.”

Let’s send CNN a message about this, patriots. Please do the following 2 steps:

It’s absolutely sickening what famous Liberals are able to get away with these days. Remember when Madonna threatened to blow up the White House and Snoop Dogg made a video where he SHOT Trump?

Well, all of those pale in comparison to the HORROR that “comedian” Kathy Griffin just put out today. (GRAPHIC Video at Bottom)

Griffin just released a Photoshoot of her holding up a severed and bloody Donald Trump’s head.

I am not even kidding. We even have the video and images, however, we decided to put them on a 2nd page since the are VERY gory and may make SOME people sick to their stomachs.

Griffin even had the nerve to brag about how “edgy” her photo shoot was and how she would have to “move to Mexico” afterward.

Edgy is NOT the right word for this. Apparently, it’s now artsy and acceptable for Liberals to produce the same videos that the cartel and Islamists make.

Look, I have told you the story and warned you about how NASTY it is, if you still wanna see the video for yourself just click the giant link bellow and have fun.

WARNING: –GRAPHIC VIDEO (CLICK HERE)–

Don’t say I didn’t warn you…

We need to fight back against this stuff. It is NOT acceptable.

I’m not even gonna begin to compare the way Republicans who hated Obama were treated versus this. It goes without saying that this would NOT be acceptable for any US President. It’s horrible.

Help to get the word out. Share this everywhere so the world can see what we are ACTUALLY dealing with. These are not hippies, folks. People who make things like this are monsters.

Should Kathy Griffin be investigated by the Secret Service for threatening the President?"

Robert De Niro has been in some good movies, but the second he opens his mouth in public it’s hard to even stand him.

Remember during the election when he was such a Hillary goon that he threatened to PUNCH President Trump? Well, look what old Robert did this time…

De Niro said Trump turned our country into a “tragic dumbass comedy.”

The actor also tried to convince the grads that they had to fight back to restore the world.

To his credit, and I say that very sparingly, at least De Niro acknowledged the possibility he MAY be wrong in his opinion.

“And where are we? There might be people who disagree on that. It’s just a nightmarish situation as far as I’m concerned.”

Still, Hollywood has gone so anti-Trump now it’s hard to tell who is genuine and who is sucking up to get work. Are all actors that gullible that they drink the Koolaid or is the movie business just that dirty?

It doesn’t really matter. The only way we can get it through their skulls that we want movies, NOT political advice is to simply stop watching them. It may suck, but they give us no choice.

If you agree the only way to defeat Robert De Niro and the Hollywood Machine is to stop watching, the share it out and let everyone know."

This is crazy. The liberal media won’t show you this at all. Bryan Cranston showed up on the set of Katie Couric to discuss his new show “Wakefield.” The following video gets a little weird when the conversation turns to politics. Watch it at 10:00 minutes in.

Cranston was a Hillary Clinton supporter during the 2016 election. He doesn’t rub it in your face like the rest of Hollywood. When asked on the state of the country, Cranston said, “One thing I can say is it’s not going to be boring.”

“The administration so far has been fraught with difficulty, and it’s been problematic. A couple wins for [President Trump] I think, and that’s fine, that’s good,” Cranston said about Neil Gorsuch.

Wait. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

Did a Hollywood star just endorse Trumps pick for Supreme Court? It sure seems like it.

Spread this everywhere and give Bryan Cranston a welcome aboard the Trump train. You don’t have to like everything Trump is doing. You just have to not hate him completely for no frickin’ reason. Amen.

Thanks Mr. Cranston for not being a Hollywood jackass. Share this if you agree."

Marcuz Rangel shared this photo taken in Batesville, Texas. The image was shared on Facebook by the South Texas Hunting Association. Reactions were mixed on the frog. Many people called into question the size of it.

Ya’ll ready for the picture. I’ll let you decide on whether you think it is fake or not.

Here are some other pictures from Marcuz’s Facebook.

People that saw it didn’t know if it was real or not. Check out the responses.

Donna couldn’t believe it.

Donna couldn’t believe that it could be real?

Hahaha. Some people couldn’t believe it.

Matt knew what it was, though.

Are you having a happy Memorial Day Weekend? I am. Share this positive story and let’s appreciate the men and women that fought for this country.

The famous and well-respected Harvard law professor and attorney, Alan Dershowitz, wants to know this: where is the crime? Where is the actual criminal statute against this thing about which the President of the United States is now being “investigated” by a Special Prosecutor?

Because that’s what Special Prosecutors, or any prosecutor for that matter, are supposed to be for: investigating CRIMES. Only, there’s not one in this case.

Then, Mr. Dershowitz said something that should embarrass and shame all Democrats involved in this witch hunt: “I don’t want us ever to become what Stalinist Russia became when Stalin was told by Lavrentiy Beria, ‘Show me the man and I’ll find you the crime.’ What is the crime?”

WOW! “Show me the man and I’ll find you the crime.”

That’s what RUSSIA would do! And that’s what the media of the United States IS DOING!

Professor Dershowitz explained that there is no criminal statute against a presidential candidate collaborating with Russia to get elected. Which President Trump has vehemently denied, by the way. But even if it were true, it’s not illegal. Neither is telling Russian diplomats classified info.

So why spend the American peoples’ money, the hard-earned money of the people who ELECTED DONALD TRUMP, on this Special Prosecutor who is supposed to be investigating actual acts that violate actual statutes?

Dershowitz went on to say that the Special Prosecutor, Robert Mueller doesn’t even have jurisdiction to investigate what is actually political, not criminal, conduct! Wow! No jurisdiction, even!

Wow! Ya’ll as an attorney, I can tell you, if he doesn’t have jurisdiction to do something, HE CAN’T DO IT!!! We need to get this out there NOW, to stop the witch hunt against our President. SHARE THIS AROUND THE WORLD, PLEASE!!!

While turmoil swirls in Washington, DC, and the media continues its witch hunt against President Trump, he just keeps working.

On Tuesday, he met with the President of Turkey, and urged him to release an American man of God, who is wrongfully jailed there.

Pastor Andrew Brunson, of North Carolina, and his wife, were held in Turkey for Visa issues. But he has been held in jail there now since October, on very unclear charges of a terrorism-link nature.

Pastor Brunson and his wife have lived in Turkey for 23, running a small Christian church there. The Turkish government hasn’t release many details about why they are holding Pastor Brunson.

Pastor Brunson wrote a letter to President Trump earlier this year, asking for his help and President Trump is doing just that!

Both President Trump and VP Pence, during their meeting with the Turkish President on Tuesday, reportedly brought up the Pastor 3 times. It is believed that Turkey may be holding the Pastor as a bargaining chip, to manipulate the U.S. to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is living in Pennsylvania and who Turkey believes is a terrorist.

It is not OK for a country to hold an innocent man, a man of God even, as a political pawn!

If you agree, and appreciate our President for his continued work in spite of all the chaos, please SHARE this article so much it gets back to him and he knows we love and support him! [H/T The Daily Caller]"

Pretty much every patriotic America understands how important it is to have a powerful and reliable handgun to protect yourself and your family. Well, have no fear, because 2017 is a HECK of a year for bada$$ new pistols!

We have analyzed and compared the BEST of the BEST to bring you a list of the 5 ultimate pistols of 2017 you just GOTTA own.

#1 – The Colt Cobra

Some of y’all may remember the Colt Cobra, the nasty little revolver that reigned supreme from 1950 until 1981. It was light weight and powerful, any enthusiasts dream.

Well, 2017 is the year of REVIVAL for this mean little gun but with 1 HUGE improvement. Colt swapped out the old aluminum body for a 100% light-weight steel. That means this baby can now handle +P ammo (and 38 special). Throw in the 2-inch barrel and a fiber optic front sight and NOBODY will be messing with you.

MSRP – $699"

(B) In all circumstances listed in (A) above, we may perform these functions directly or use a third-party vendor to perform these functions on our behalf who will be obligated to use your personal information only to perform services for us. Also, if you access our Website from a third party social platform, such as Facebook, we may share non-personal information with that platform to the extent permitted by your agreement with it and its privacy settings.

(C) If you are a job applicant or service provider to the Company, and your personal information is submitted through the Website when applying for a position or job with the Company, the information will be used solely to consider and act upon your application materials. We may retain your personal information, but only to consider your application for current or future available positions or jobs.

(C) Do Not Track Disclosure. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. However, because of the uncertainty of DNT in the internet industry, and the various factors and players conforming compliance, we may not recognize nor respond to DNT signals.

VIII. Accessing and Correcting Your Information.

If you choose to close your account or terminate your relationship with the Services, including by unsubscribing from the newsletter, we will retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Services or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy above, retention of that information will be subject to those companies’ policies, typically found on their websites.

IX. Deactivation; Termination of Your Account.

(A) When your account is deactivated or terminated, for any or no reason as may be determined by the Terms of Use, we take reasonable efforts to make sure it is no longer viewable on the Website. We are not responsible for any information, pictures, comments, or other content that is deleted from our systems resulting from the deactivation of your account.

(B) To prevent abuse of the Website by a user following termination or deletion of an account, we shall retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that the user does not open a new account or profile in violation of our Terms of Use or other restrictions, and to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.

(C) After you remove information from your profile, if you created one, or delete your account, copies of that information may still be viewable or accessed to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or to the extent such information has been shared with search engines. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information, they may retain such information to the extent permitted subject to their respective terms of service or privacy policies. Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies owned by the Company for up to 30 days to enable restoration or reactivation subject to successful appeal to Company, but will not be available to other users in the meantime.

X. Your California Privacy Rights.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to [email protected]

XI. Data Security.

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website.

"Ben Goldman – President/Co-Founder

Texas-born and Tennessee-raised, Ben Goldman is a man who loves and respects his country, and all-American roots. Growing up, he and his family traveled the world, allowing for experiences and education of different practices and history. A fascination for politics started at a young age when Ben began reading various writings by Benjamin Franklin, including Poor Richard’s Almanack, which he has carried a copy with him for almost two decades. Finding leisure and interest into the depths of American history has always been Ben’s calling card.

In 2013, Ben graduated from the University of Tennessee with a degree in Entrepreneurial Business Management. Accompanied by this newfound education and longterm passion for politics, he was brought on as the COO and head editor at USA Liberty Media, LLC. Soon after, he began writing political pieces for the news organization, and eventually decided to bring on board his good friend, and future Liberty Writers partner, Paris Wade.

Almost immediately, articles written by the two young men began achieving massive vitality. One in particular – the 2015 breaking news story of France’s response to ISIS’ Paris attack – received millions of views in a span of 2 hours, shutting down the website where it was posted.

After realizing their successes, Ben and Paris decided to venture out from USA Liberty Media, and in August of 2016, they formed their own company, Liberty Writers. In a span of just months, Ben managed to grow the website from the ground up, where it is now ranked by Alexa as one of the Top 300 websites in the United States. Currently, Liberty Writers reaches an average of 20+ million unique visitors per month, further solidifying Ben Goldman into one of political media’s leading writers and voices.

Presenting authentic and factual news in a highly entertaining manner is what has made Liberty Writers an overnight success. Ben’s particular writing style is humorous and honest, and his use of determined, bold headlines is what motivates millions of people to read his editorials.

Inspired to change the world and improve his country, Ben has no fear of voicing his opinions, but yet always remembers to put his audience before himself. With a determined spirit that is unstoppable, he foresees that the future for Liberty Writers will entail viral video content and an expansion toward a broader range of topics."
